			<p class="Normal-no-indent ParaOverride-1"><span class="italic">This article is based on a presentation given on January 15, 2020, at the Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center at Brigham Young University. It was sponsored by BYU Studies, the BYU College of Humanities, the Interpreter Foundation, and Book of Mormon Central.</span></p>
			<p class="•1st-paragrph ParaOverride-2"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">I</span>n this paper, I will provide an overview of the two latest published <br />&#160;books in the Book of Mormon critical text project:</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-3">Part 5: <span class="italic">The King James Quotations in the Book of Mormon</span><br />Part 6: <span class="italic">Spelling in the Manuscripts and Editions</span></p>
			<p class="Normal">As the numbers indicate, these two books form a part of a much larger publishing project. The fundamental work in the project is <span class="italic">The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text,</span> published in 2009 by Yale University Press and now in its fourth printing. Supporting this single volume of the text are the volumes of the critical text project itself, with the completed volumes and parts of volumes marked with a check mark&#160;<span class="Zapf">✓</span> (partially completed volumes or parts of volumes are marked with an outlined check mark <span class="hollow">✓</span>):</p>
			<p class="•subhead--1-">Published Volumes in the Critical Text Project:</p>
			<p class="volumes ParaOverride-4">&#9;<span class="Zapf">✓</span>&#9;volume 1 (2001) </p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph"><span class="italic">The Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon </span></p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph">The Joseph Smith Papers will publish a revised version of this volume, with myself and Robin Scott Jensen as editors, estimated to be finished in late 2021. It will have photographs with corresponding transcripts for all the extant leaves and fragments of the Book of Mormon (about 28&#160;percent of the text).</p>
			<p class="volumes">&#9;<span class="Zapf">✓</span>&#9;volume 2 (2001)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph"><span class="italic">The Printer’s Manuscript of the Book of Mormon</span></p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph">The Joseph Smith Papers published a revised version of this volume in 2015, edited by myself and Robin Scott Jensen. It includes a color photograph for each leaf of the printer’s manuscript. Except for a total of three lines at the bottom of the first leaf, the manuscript is fully extant.</p>
			<p class="volumes">&#9;<span class="Zapf">✓</span>&#9;volume 4 (2004–2009)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-5"><span class="italic">Analysis of Textual Variants of the Book of Mormon,</span> first &#173;edition, ATV1</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph">This volume is made up of six physical books, published one each year from 2004 through 2009. This volume, as a complete set, is now out of print (although individual numbers are still available). Even so, a searchable PDF version is available online at <span class="italic">Book of Mormon Central </span>and also at <span class="italic">Interpreter: A&#160;Journal of Latter-day Saint Faith and Scholarship. </span>A second, revised edition of the physical set, ATV2, was published by BYU Studies in 2017 and is available from them.</p>
			<p class="volumes">&#9;<span class="hollow">✓</span>&#9;volume 3 (in progress)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph"><span class="italic">The History of the Text of the Book of Mormon</span></p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph">Ultimately, there will be 8 parts (that is, books) in this volume. The first six are now complete; the first five have been published; the sixth is in the press.</p>
			<p class="volumes">&#9;&#9;<span class="Zapf">✓</span>&#9;parts 1–2, <span class="italic">Grammatical Variation, </span>GV (2016)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph">These two books, written in collaboration with Stanford Carmack, provide a complete history of the editing of the Book of Mormon text. The main argument of this work is that the so-called nonstandard English in the original text of the Book of Mormon does not represent Joseph Smith’s upstate New York dialect, but instead it is acceptable language usage dating from the 1500s and 1600s.</p>
			<p class="volumes">&#9;&#9;<span class="Zapf">✓</span>&#9;parts 3–4, <span class="italic">The Nature of the Original Language, </span>NOL (2018)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph">This work, again written with the collaboration of Stanford Carmack, argues that the Book of Mormon language (its word meanings, phrases, expressions, and sentence structure) represents the archaic Early Modern English spoken from the 1530s up to the 1730s, and definitely not Joseph Smith’s dialectal &#173;English dating from the 1820s. Moreover, the themes of the Book of Mormon date from the same older time period and represent issues that were prominent among Reformed and Radical Protestants rather than the issues that were prevalent during Joseph Smith’s time.</p>
			<p class="volume-hanging">&#9;&#9;<span class="Zapf">✓</span>&#9;part 5, <span class="italic">The King James Quotations in the Book of Mormon</span>, KJQ (2019)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph">This part analyzes the numerous biblical quotations in the Book of Mormon, of which all but one come from the archaic 1611 King James translation of the Bible.</p>
			<p class="volumes">&#9;&#9;<span class="Zapf">✓</span>&#9;part 6, <span class="italic">Spelling in the Manuscripts and Editions, </span>SPL (2020)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph">In this part we investigate just what the misspellings and slips can tell us about the scribal and typesetting processes that the Book of Mormon text has undergone for the nearly 200 years since it was first revealed to Joseph Smith.</p>
			<p class="volume-hanging">&#9;&#9;<span class="hollow">✓</span>&#9;part 7, <span class="italic">Transmission of the Text: From the Manuscripts Through the Editions</span>, TXT (estimated to appear in 2021)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph">Here we follow the substantive changes that have occurred in the transmission of the Book of Mormon text, from Joseph Smith’s dictation of the text, to the scribes taking down that dictation (the original manuscript), then copying that text to produce a second copy (the printer’s manuscript). We then turn to the 1830 typesetter’s setting the type from the printer’s manuscript (and from the original manuscript for one-sixth of the text). And then we follow the transmission through the printed editions, from the 1830 edition up to the 2013 LDS edition. For each edition, we establish the copytext and then analyze the kinds of errors, corrections, and conjectural emendations that each edition has undergone. Also of some importance, we look at the changes in format that the Book of Mormon has undergone, from the manuscripts (and their sentence-long chapters) to the double-column, versified paragraphs now used in the current LDS edition.</p>
			<p class="volume-hanging">&#9;&#9;<span class="hollow">✓</span>&#9;part 8, <span class="italic">Textual Criticism of the Book of Mormon</span>, CRT (estimated to appear in 2022)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph">In this last part, we will consider the principles of textual criti&#173;cism and how they have been followed (or not followed) in the transmission of the Book of Mormon text. There will be a history of previous attempts at doing critical text work on the Book of Mormon as well as, of course, a detailed history of this critical text project (which began in 1988). Finally, we will turn to various issues that have continually beset those attempting to do critical text work on the Book of Mormon, including the question of conjectural emendations and the degree to which they have been allowed in the text.</p>
			<p class="volumes">&#9;<span class="hollow">✓</span>&#9;volume 5 (in progress)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph"><span class="italic">A Complete Electronic Collation of the Book of Mormon </span></p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph">When all of volume 3 has been published, all 8 parts, I will be releasing the computerized collation, with its WordCruncher searchable electronic comparison of the two manuscripts against 20 significant editions of the Book of Mormon (from 1830 through 1981), showing every difference in the text (not only word differences but also every difference in spelling, punctuation, capitalization, paragraphing, and versification). Ever since the late 1990s, I have been using a preliminary version of this collation in writing all the parts of volumes 3 and 4. It is the indispensable tool for doing research on the Book of Mormon text.</p>
			<p class="•subhead--1-"><span class="Minion-bold">Part 5, </span><span class="Minion-bold-italic">The King James Quotations in the Book of Mormon</span><span class="Minion-bold"> (KJQ)</span></p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">This paper will concentrate on describing the important findings discussed in parts&#160;5 and 6 of volume&#160;3. In this first half of the paper, I consider part&#160;5, <span class="italic">The King James Quotations in the Book of Mormon.</span> The most important question, right from the start, is: What is a King James quotation? One way to look at this question is to ask how many identical words in a row do we need between the two texts before we can say we have a quotation? In trying to identify the quotations, I quickly found that I could not rely on my intuitions to determine what was an actual literal quotation, in distinction to what was a paraphrastic quotation. In other words, intuition was insufficient. Yet whatever I would say in this whole book rested on determining which citations were actual biblical quotations.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Here Stanford Carmack came to the rescue and suggested that we first identify all the precisely identical sequences of words between the two texts, the King James text (on the one hand) and the original text of the Book of Mormon (on the other hand). Carmack, using various WordCruncher techniques, was able to find all the identical <span class="italic">n-</span>grams (strings of <span class="italic">n </span>identical words) that occurred in the entire King James Bible and the entire Book of Mormon text. This led him to provide me with all the examples of identical word-sequences, from a high of <span class="italic">n&#160;</span>=&#160;261 down to a low of <span class="italic">n&#160;</span>=&#160;3. As I examined all of these identical <span class="italic">n-</span>grams, I&#160;noticed that when <span class="italic">n</span> equaled at least 16, the sequence of identical words clearly fell into the class of King James quotations, in agreement with my intuitions; but when <span class="italic">n</span> fell below 16, I started to find long nonclausal phrases that seemed more like paraphrases than quotations. So I used <span class="italic">n&#160;</span>=&#160;16 as a cut-off point between the quotations and the paraphrases, which gave me a total of 36 passages in the Book of Mormon that could definitely be called literal quotations from the King James Bible. These 36&#160;passages are all listed and discussed in section 1 of KJQ.</p>
			<p class="Normal ParaOverride-6">Here is the beginning of the list of identical word strings with <span class="italic">n</span> equal to at least 16, listed in order of the passages with the longest identical <span class="italic">n</span>-grams; I also list for each passage the total number of identical <span class="italic">n-</span>grams of length 16 or greater contained within that passage:</p>

			<p class="double-indent"><span class="Minion-bold">and all thine enemies shall be cut off </span></p>
			<p class="example-comment">For each of these literal quotations, some particular clause remains incomplete. Even so, the incompleteness is due to a minor word difference that does not affect the overall meaning.</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">On the other side of the dividing line, here are the two longest borderline paraphrastic quotations:</p>
			<p class="volumes"><span class="italic">n</span> = 15</p>
			<p class="example-lines">3 Nephi 11:25&#9;Matthew 28:19</p>
			<p class="scriptures">having authority given me &#9;go ye therefore <br />of Jesus Christ&#9;and teach all nations<br /><span class="italic">I baptize you </span><span class="Minion-bold">in the name &#9;</span><span class="italic">baptizing them </span><span class="Minion-bold">in the name</span><br /><span class="Minion-bold">of the Father and of the Son &#9;of the Father and of the Son<br />and of the Holy Ghost&#9;and of the Holy Ghost</span></p>
			<p class="example-comment">Here we have a long conjunctive prepositional phrase. Both deal with baptism, but the Book of Mormon passage gives the actual words of the prayer while the King James passage refers to the apostles of Jesus Christ and their calling to baptize.</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent"><span class="italic">n </span>= 14</p>
			<p class="example-lines">Helaman 10:7&#9;Matthew 18:19</p>

			<p class="example-comment">The second half of this passage is literally quoted for <span class="italic">n</span>&#160;=&#160;14 words, but the first half is paraphrastically quoted, using the verb <span class="italic">seal</span> in the Book of Mormon version but the verb <span class="italic">bind</span> in the biblical quotation.</p>
			<p class="Normal">In section 2 of KJQ, I provide an overview of the variety of paraphrastic biblical quotations in the Book of Mormon. In all, I catagorize 83&#160;paraphrastic quotations in that second section, including every case of <span class="italic">n</span>-gram identity from <span class="italic">n</span>&#160;=&#160;15 down to <span class="italic">n</span>&#160;=&#160;7 as well as a few additional cases with <span class="italic">n</span> less than 7. Here, for instance, is a paraphrastic quotation with two instances of three-word identity (namely, “the resurrection of”) surrounded by seven instances of one-word identity (here underlined), all of which occur in the same specific order (<span class="italic">they, good, life, and, they, evil, </span>and <span class="italic">damnation</span>):</p>
			<p class="example-lines">Mosiah 16:11&#9;John 5:29</p>

			<p class="Normal">The next question we ask is: Are all the Book of Mormon biblical quotations from the King James Bible? For the vast majority of phrases in the biblical quotations, the closest biblical reading is from the King James Bible and not earlier English translations of the Bible, as can be seen in the following conjoined verb phrase taken from the Beatitudes:</p>
			<p class="example-lines">Matthew 5:11 ~ 3 Nephi 12:11</p>

			<p class="Normal ParaOverride-10">Yet the King James Bible is derived from earlier English-language Bibles, and this means that for many biblical phrases in the Book of Mormon we cannot uniquely assign the King James Bible as the source for the quotation: For instance, in the following lineup of the translations for a specific conjunctive adverbial phrase in Isaiah 2:15 (quoted in 2 Nephi 12:15), the Book of Mormon phraseology is not only identical to the 1611 King James Bible but also to the 1568 Bishops’ Bible:</p>

			<p class="example-comment ParaOverride-11">Here the three editions from the 1530s are identical to each other, but dramatically different from the later English editions. In this case, as in many verses in Isaiah, it is the 1560 Geneva Bible that made the basic revision to the biblical reading, yet in this particular case the Geneva text retained the adjective <span class="italic">strong,</span> but this was soon changed to <span class="italic">fenced</span> in the 1568 Bishops’ Bible. The result was that in this case the King James reading followed the Bishops’ Bible, but that is not surprising since the Bishops’ Bible was the copytext for the King James Bible.</p>
			<p class="Normal ParaOverride-12">But returning to our original question: Are there any biblical phrases in the Book of Mormon that derive from biblical sources other than the King James Bible? And the answer is that there is one—but only one—and in this case the Book of Mormon text has two conjoined phrases, one from the Greek Septuagint and the other from the Masoretic Hebrew:</p>
			<p class="example-lines">Isaiah 2:16 ~ 2 Nephi 12:16</p>
			<p class="comparisons">&#9;Coverdale 1535&#9;&#9;upon all&#9;ships of the sea</p>

			<p class="example-comment ParaOverride-11">Basically, the Book of Mormon text combines the Coverdale 1535 reading with the Geneva 1560 reading (or, equivalently, the Greek reading with the Hebrew one), although the Book of Mormon reading adds a couple of function words, <span class="italic">and</span> along with <span class="italic">the.</span></p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent ParaOverride-12">The great mystery here, of course, is how Joseph Smith, if he was the author (the English-language translator) of the Book of Mormon, could have known about the Greek reading (or its occurrence in one of the earlier English Bible translations from the 1530s) in order to insert it into his Book of Mormon quotation, otherwise totally based upon the King James Bible.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The next question we undertake to determine is the King James copytext for the biblical quotations in the Book of Mormon. Since we have determined that the King James Bible is the base text for Book of Mormon quotations, we can ask a specific question: Which edition of the King James Bible do these quotations depend upon? Is it the original 1611 first printing, or is it a printing close to 1828, when the Book of Mormon began to be translated, or is it some printing in between? It is easy to establish that the copytext was definitely not the first printing or the second, both in 1611, nor in fact any edition prior to 1660. This is because there are 9&#160;archaic or incorrect word forms and 7&#160;alternative syntactic readings that were in editions prior to 1660, yet there is no sign at all in the Book of Mormon text for these readings:</p>
			<p class="example-lines">archaic or incorrect word forms removed by 1660</p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="italic">middest </span>(4&#160;times),<span class="italic"> haddest </span>(1&#160;time),<span class="italic"> charets </span>(2&#160;times), <span class="italic">stablish </span>(1&#160;time),<span class="italic"> renowmed </span>(1 time), <span class="italic">thorow </span>(2&#160;times), <span class="italic">kinreds </span>(1&#160;time), <span class="italic">Racha </span>(1&#160;time), and<span class="italic"> Gebeah </span>(1&#160;time, a typo for <span class="italic">Gibeah,</span> but only in the first 1611 printing)</p>
			<p class="example-lines">alternative syntactic forms removed by 1660</p>
			<p class="double-indent">“sing, O <span class="Minion-bold">heaven</span>” &gt; “sing, O <span class="Minion-bold">heavens</span>” (Isaiah 49:13)</p>

			<p class="double-indent">“right doeth” &gt; “right<span class="Minion-bold"> hand </span>doeth” (Matthew 6:3)</p>
			<p class="double-indent">“thy <span class="Minion-bold">hooves</span>” &gt; “thy <span class="Minion-bold">hoofs</span>” (Micah 4:13)</p>

			<p class="double-indent">“and shall go” &gt; “and <span class="Minion-bold">ye</span> shall go” (Malachi 4:2)</p>
			<p class="example-comment">The only archaic form that could have been in the copytext for the Book of Mormon biblical quotations is <span class="italic">astonied,</span> instead of the expected <span class="italic">astonished. </span>This form is found in Isaiah 52:14 in the current LDS Bible and in some of the King James editions printed in the early 1800s (2 out of 7 in my sampling); it also occurred in all 12 editions I sampled from 1611 up to the early 1700s. The Book of Mormon reading for Isaiah 52:14, in 3 Nephi 20:44, however, reads <span class="italic">astonished.</span> But this means little since the King James copytext could have read <span class="italic">astonied,</span> yet either Joseph Smith or Oliver Cowdery, his scribe in this case, could have automatically replaced <span class="italic">astonied</span> with the expected <span class="italic">astonished</span>. Or the copytext could have actually read <span class="italic">astonished, </span>which means that in this case neither Joseph nor Oliver made any change at all. So we have to set aside this example since it does not provide clear evidence for the copytext.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Evidence from variation in the King James italics is less helpful in determining the copytext for the Book of Mormon quotations. There is some relationship, although rather weak, between italics in the King James Bible and missing words in the original text of the Book of Mormon. So if a later King James edition introduced italics into a particular passage and the Book of Mormon quotation is lacking the word or phrase there, we can potentially use the date of that later edition to determine the copytext for the Book of Mormon quotations. It turns out that there is only one example of later italics that could be used in this way. The clause-final verb <span class="italic">do</span> in Matthew 6:7 is set in italics beginning in the 1770s; and the corresponding Book of Mormon passage happens to lack the <span class="italic">do:</span></p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-13">Matthew 6:7&#9;use not vain repetitions as the heathen <span class="italic">do</span><br />3 Nephi 13:7&#9;use not vain repetitions as the heathen</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">The italics in two other cases of clause-final verb were added considerably earlier to the King James text:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-14">Isaiah 49:18&#9;and bind them <span class="italic">on thee</span>          as a bride <span class="italic">doeth</span> / <span class="italic">doth</span><br />1 Nephi 21:18&#9;and bind them              even as a bride</p>
			<p class="example-comment">The clause-final <span class="italic">doeth / doth</span> was set in italics beginning in the 1630s.</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-15">Matthew 6:5&#9;thou shalt not be as the hypocrites <span class="italic">are</span><br />3 Nephi 13:5&#9;thou shalt not be as the hypocrites</p>
			<p class="example-comment">The clause-final <span class="italic">are</span> was set in italics beginning in the 1660s.</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">These three examples, taken together, imply that the copytext for the Book of Mormon biblical quotations dates from after the 1760s. But we must remember that this is the only example involving italics that provides any support for dating the copytext, especially a later dating. The 16&#160;examples involving word differences imply that the copytext could date up to a century earlier.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Sometimes researchers have suggested that Oliver Cowdery, the scribe for most of the original manuscript, copied the biblical quotations, at least the longer ones, from an actual King James Bible (but one altered in advance by Joseph Smith). There are extant portions of biblical quotations in the original manuscript in the hand of Oliver Cowdery (all of Isaiah 48–49 in 1 Nephi 20–21, plus fragments of Isaiah 50–51 in 2 Nephi 7–8 and of Isaiah 13–14 in 2 Nephi 23–24). For all three of these extant portions of the original manuscript, there is no sign of any influence from the King James spellings for words. Instead, we get only Oliver Cowdery’s typical misspellings in O, such as the following:</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-3"><span class="italic">hoast, declair, least </span>[<span class="italic">lest</span>], <span class="italic">moulton, verry, destroid, lead </span>[<span class="italic">led</span>], <span class="italic">shaddow,</span> <span class="italic">hungar, the</span> [<span class="italic">thee</span>], <span class="italic">to</span> [<span class="italic">too</span>], <span class="italic">thurst, weopon, streach, hiden, name sake, abhoreth, cloath, exceptable </span>[<span class="italic">acceptable</span>], <span class="italic">spaned, removeing</span></p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Thus the evidence is very strong that Joseph Smith dictated all three of these Isaiah passages to Oliver Cowdery. Moreover, it should be noted, there are some paraphrastic quotations that switch from one King James phrase to another; it seems very unlikely that Joseph would have had Oliver flipping through a Bible to copy these kinds of quotations (or that Joseph himself would have flipped through a Bible in order to read off the same):</p>

			<p class="Normal">When we consider the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible (the JST), we find that this is precisely what Joseph Smith was willing to do, at least sometimes: When Joseph came to parts of Isaiah that were in the Book of Mormon, he had the scribe create the “inspired” version of the biblical text by directly copying at least some of those portions from a copy of the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon. Joseph undoubtedly assumed that his earlier dictation of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon included inspired changes, but he did not take into account the possibility that errors had entered the Isaiah text during the early transmission of the Book of Mormon text. In fact, for Isaiah 50 he did not even mark up his Bible with the Book of Mormon changes, but had the scribe simply copy the equivalent of 2 Nephi 7 from the 1830 edition, along with the following errors (in the following list of eight errors, I&#160;first give the original reading in the Book of Mormon, which is the same as the King James reading, then the 1830 reading):</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent ParaOverride-19">&#9;verse 2&#9;wherefore when I <span class="Minion-bold">came</span> &gt; <span class="Minion-bold">come</span></p>

			<p class="Normal">Another important question in dealing with the King James quotations in the Book of Mormon is this: Are there any significant differences in the Book of Mormon version? Here are three:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-16">Isaiah 51:19–20&#9;2 Nephi 8:19–20</p>
			<p class="scriptures ParaOverride-16">these two <span class="Minion-bold-italic">things </span>are come unto thee&#160;. . .&#9;these two <span class="Minion-bold">sons</span> are come unto thee&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.<br />thy sons have fainted&#9;thy sons have fainted <span class="Minion-bold">save these two</span></p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">The Book of Mormon text is apparently alluding to Revelation 11:1–12 and its prophecy about two prophets who will use incredible powers to hold back the armies of the nations that will surround the temple mount in Jerusalem prior to the second coming of Christ. Interestingly, this interpretation dates back at least to a footnote that Orson Pratt added to this passage in his editing for the 1879 edition of the Book of Mormon (and which was continued by James E. Talmage in his editing for the 1920 LDS edition and then by later editors into more recent LDS editions, dating from 1981 and 2013).</p>
			<p class="Normal">A second example might be initially misinterpreted as a visual error since the Book of Mormon word <span class="italic">proud</span> could be a misreading of the Isaiah word <span class="italic">found.</span> But the following conjoined clause with its replacement of the italicized pronoun <span class="italic">them</span> with the noun phrase <span class="italic">the wicked</span> makes it clear that the word <span class="italic">proud</span> is fully intended:</p>
			<p class="example-lines">Isaiah 13:15&#9;2 Nephi 23:15</p>
			<p class="scriptures">every one that is <span class="Minion-bold">found</span>&#9;every one that is <span class="Minion-bold">proud</span><br />shall be thrust through&#9;shall be thrust through<br />and every one that is joined&#9;<span class="Minion-bold">yea</span> and every one that is joined<br /><span class="Minion-bold-italic">unto them</span> shall fall&#9;<span class="Minion-bold">to the wicked</span> shall fall</p>
			<p class="Normal">A third example is found in the Sermon on the Mount where the Book of Mormon version omits the phrase “without a cause”:</p>
			<p class="example-lines">Matthew 5:22&#9;3 Nephi 12:22</p>
			<p class="scriptures">whosoever is angry with his brother&#9;whosoever is angry with his brother<br /><span class="Minion-bold">without a cause</span><br />shall be in danger of <span class="Minion-bold">the</span> judgment&#9;shall be in danger of <span class="Minion-bold">his</span> judgment</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">The phrase “without a cause” (the single word <span class="italic">eikē</span> in the Greek) is missing from the earliest Greek New Testament manuscripts. Of course, the added phrase “without a cause” makes Jesus’s statement vacuous since we always have a cause for our anger! The whole point of this passage in the Sermon on the Mount is anger and how it can lead to violence, even murder, irrespective of whether it is “righteous anger”.</p>
			<p class="Normal">One very important section in KJQ deals with the possible influence of the King James italics in accounting for the textual differences between the Book of Mormon and the King James versions of the biblical text. When we line up the 36 biblical quotations in the last section of KJQ, we can calculate the following statistics for the differences:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-7">&#9;total number of differences&#9;712<br />Δ&#9;differences not related to italics&#9;549<br /><span class="italic">i</span>&#9;differences related to italics&#9;163&#9;22.9 percent</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-7">&#9;total number of italicized cases&#9;425<br />x&#9;italicized cases not changed&#9;262<br /><span class="italic">i</span>&#9;italicized cases changed&#9;163&#9;38.4 percent</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">In other words, less than a fourth of the textual differences can be assigned to the italics; and of all the cases of italics in the King James text, over three-fifths are left unchanged. Obviously, any theory that relies solely upon italics for determining the textual differences will be woefully inadequate.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Nonetheless, there are some cases where italics seem to be playing a role in determining the Book of Mormon biblical quotations. One particular type involves the italicized linking verb <span class="italic">be</span> in the King James translation. First of all, there are six cases (with a total of 11 instances) where the italicized <span class="italic">be</span> verb is omitted in the original text of the Book of Mormon but supplied by later editing (either by Joseph Smith for the 1837 edition or by James E. Talmage for the 1920 LDS edition):</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-20"> (1)&#9;Isaiah 6:5&#9;woe <span class="Minion-bold-italic">is</span> me<br />&#9;2 Nephi 16:5&#9;woe     me</p>

			<p class="Normal-no-indent">This makes a total of 10 cases of the deleted linking verb <span class="italic">be,</span> with 15&#160;instances in all.</p>
			<p class="Normal">But the situation is more complex than simply identifying these instances of the deleted <span class="italic">be</span> verb. We must look at the other side of the coin: namely, we must consider the fact that the biblical quotations in the Book of Mormon happen to retain 54 instances of italicized <span class="italic">is,</span> as in the following sampling:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-7">Isaiah 49:4 (~ 1 Nephi 21:4)&#9;surely my judgment <span class="italic">is</span> with the <span class="CharOverride-5">Lord</span><br />Isaiah 51:13 (~ 2 Nephi 8:13)&#9;and where <span class="italic">is</span> the fury of the oppressor<br />Isaiah 6:3 (~ 2 Nephi 16:3)&#9;holy holy holy <span class="italic">is</span> the <span class="CharOverride-5">Lord</span> of Hosts<br />Isaiah 13:22 (~ 2 Nephi 23:22)&#9;and her time <span class="italic">is</span> near to come<br />Exodus 20:4 (~ Mosiah 13:12)&#9;or that <span class="italic">is</span> in the earth beneath<br />Matthew 7:13 (~ 3 Nephi 14:13)&#9;for wide <span class="italic">is</span> the gate and broad <span class="italic">is</span> the way<br />Isaiah 54:17 (~ 3 Nephi 22:17)&#9;and their righteousness<span class="italic"> is</span> of me<br />Malachi 3:2 (~ 3 Nephi 24:2)&#9;for he <span class="italic">is</span> like a refiner’s fire</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">In fact, the <span class="italic">is</span> could be omitted in some of these cases without any particular impairment in understanding, as in the 3 Nephi 14:13 example from Matthew 7:13: “for wide the gate and broad the way”.</p>
			<p class="Normal">One particular place of biblical quotation involves considerable alteration from the King James text, and this is in the Sermon on the Mount. The Book of Mormon version adapts the Sermon so that it is applicable to the Nephites, yet all of the following changes are made without any consideration of italics:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-7">no violent bodily harm: cutting out the eye, cutting off the hand<br />no reference to publicans, scribes, Pharisees, or Gentiles<br />no altars or gifts<br />no Jewish judicial system, although prisons still exist <br />the Nephite monetary system is used (<span class="italic">senine</span> instead of <span class="italic">farthing</span>)<br />for the Nephites, the Mosaic law is a written law (not just an oral law)<br />the Lord emphasizes that we should give alms<br />worrying about tomorrow applies only to the twelve disciples</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Two striking aspects about the textual changes in the Sermon on the Mount are (1)&#160;most of the changes occur in the first chapter (3&#160;Nephi&#160;12 ~ Matthew&#160;5), and (2)&#160;relatively few changes involve italics (only 6.6&#160;percent). Here are the relevant statistics:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-21">&#9;&#9;&#9;Δ&#9;<span class="italic">i</span>&#9;x</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-15">3 Nephi 12&#9;Matthew 5&#9;92&#9;2&#9;10<br />3 Nephi 13&#9;Matthew 6&#9;16&#9;5&#9;4<br />3 Nephi 14–15:1a&#9;Matthew 7&#9;6&#9;1&#9;5</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-4">&#9;<span class="CharOverride-5">totals</span>&#9;&#9;114&#9;8&#9;19</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">As before, Δ stands for differences not related to italics, <span class="italic">i</span> for differences related to italics, and x to italicized cases not changed.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Finally, we should mention one important difference between the large plates of Nephi and the small plates in the use of italics. In the large plates, from the books of Mosiah through Moroni, only 9.0&#160;percent of the changes in the biblical quotations involve italics, while in the small plates, in the books of 1&#160;and 2&#160;Nephi, a much larger percentage of the changes, 30.6&#160;percent, involve italics. In other words, changes involving italics are over three times more frequent in the small plates than elsewhere in the text.</p>
			<p class="Normal">We now turn to the anachronistic elements in the King James quotations in the Book of Mormon. These translation elements have serious consequences for any translation theory of the Book of Mormon. Here we identify three types of anachronistic elements: (1)&#160;cultural translations, (2)&#160;translation errors, and (3)&#160;later textual readings.</p>
			<p class="Normal">In the King James Bible, cultural translations refer to intentional re-interpretations of the original biblical language so that the resulting English-language reading will be understood by speakers of Early Modern English living in England in the 1500s and 1600s. There are 12 of these listed in KJQ, including these two:</p>
			<p class="example-lines"><span class="italic">candle</span> and <span class="italic">candlestick</span> in 3 Nephi 12:15 (~ Matthew 5:15)</p>
			<p class="double-indent">do men light a <span class="Minion-bold">candle </span>and put it under a bushel</p>
			<p class="double-indent">nay but on a <span class="Minion-bold">candlestick</span></p>
			<p class="example-comment ParaOverride-22">Here in the Greek original, the word for <span class="italic">candle</span> means ‘lamp’ and the word for <span class="italic">candlestick </span>means ‘lampstand’ (and these lamps are not modern lamps either).</p>
			<p class="example-lines"><span class="italic">dry-shod,</span> meaning ‘with dry shoes’, in 2 Nephi 21:15 (~ Isaiah 11:15)</p>
			<p class="double-indent">he shall shake his hand over the river</p>
			<p class="double-indent">and shall smite it in the seven streams</p>
			<p class="double-indent">and make men go over <span class="Minion-bold">dry-shod</span></p>
			<p class="example-comment">Here the Hebrew original as well as the Greek and the Latin translations simply use the phrase “in sandals”, without any reference to getting one’s sandals wet. If the river water had been running, the Israelites would have crossed by taking off their sandals. But in England, when crossing rivers, people would have kept their shoes on, no matter whether water was running or not. It would have made no sense to Englishmen to have translated this passage as “and make men go over with their shoes on”.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Even more serious is the problem of translation errors in the King James Bible. There are 19 examples listed in KJQ, of which 18 occur in the very difficult Isaiah passages. Here are two of them:</p>
			<p class="example-lines"><span class="italic">rent,</span> referring to a torn part or to a tear, in 2 Nephi 13:24 (~Isaiah 3:24)</p>
			<p class="double-indent">and instead of a girdle, a <span class="Minion-bold">rent</span></p>
			<p class="double-indent">and instead of well-set hair, baldness</p>
			<p class="example-comment">In the Hebrew, there are two different verbs, but with different vocalizations, that take the same consonants <span class="italic">n-q-p.</span> One of the verbs means ‘to tear’, the other ‘to go around, surround’. The noun here in Isaiah 3:24 could mean either ‘a tear’ or ‘a rope or cord’. Modern translators interpret this line as taking the second meaning: “and instead of a belt, a rope” (thus the English Standard Version, 2011).</p>
			<p class="example-lines"><span class="italic">satyr,</span> a Greek word referring to a woodland god, in 2 Nephi 23:21 (~&#160;Isaiah 13:21)</p>
			<p class="double-indent">and owls shall dwell there</p>
			<p class="double-indent">and <span class="Minion-bold">satyrs</span> shall dance there</p>
			<p class="example-comment">The Hebrew word here in the singular is <span class="italic">śā</span><span class="TNR-ital">ʕ</span><span class="italic">īr</span> (with a glottal stop as the second consonant rather than a <span class="italic">t</span>); in the Hebrew this word refers to hairy demons or monsters that inhabit the deserts. This word was incorrectly translated by the 1560 Geneva Bible translators into the phonetically similar Greek word <span class="italic">satyr,</span> which refers to a woodland god that is half-human and half-beast.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Finally, the King James Bible, following the Textus Receptus (the received Greek text originating with Erasmus’s 1516 Greek New Testament), adopts several readings that are lacking in the earliest Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, such as these two examples:</p>
			<p class="example-lines">3 Nephi 13:4 (~ Matthew 6:4, Textus Receptus)</p>
			<p class="double-indent">and thy Father which seeth in secret</p>
			<p class="double-indent">himself shall reward thee <span class="Minion-bold">openly</span></p>
			<p class="example-comment">The phrase representing <span class="italic">openly</span> is lacking in the earliest Greek manuscripts.</p>
			<p class="example-lines">3 Nephi 13:12–14 (~ Matthew 6:13–14, Textus Receptus)</p>
			<p class="double-indent">and lead us not into temptation</p>
			<p class="double-indent">but deliver us from evil</p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="Minion-bold">for thine is the kingdom</span></p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="Minion-bold">and the power and the glory forever</span></p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="Minion-bold">amen</span></p>
			<p class="example-comment">The traditional doxology to the Lord’s prayer is lacking in the earliest Greek manuscripts.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The last half of part 5, from pages 227 through 431, is assigned to various kinds of source material. We first have 45 pages dedicated to the King James vocabulary in the Book of Mormon. This not only includes all the words in the Book of Mormon that occur solely in biblical quotations (both literal and paraphrastic), but also more general words that take on specialized King James meanings in the quotations. Both the first and the last words in the vocabulary list are like this. The first verb listed, <span class="italic">abide, </span>typically means ‘to dwell’ or ‘to live by (the law)’ in the Book of Mormon text proper, but there is one biblical quotation where it takes on the archaic King James meaning ‘to endure’: “but who may <span class="Minion-bold">abide</span> the day of his coming?” (3 Nephi 24:2 ~ Malachi 3:2). And the last verb listed, <span class="italic">write,</span> takes the archaic meaning ‘to write down’ or ‘to record’ in two biblical quotations: “every one that is <span class="Minion-bold">written</span> among the living in Jerusalem” (2 Nephi 14:3 ~ Isaiah 4:3); and “the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may <span class="Minion-bold">write</span> them” (2 Nephi 20:19 ~ Isaiah 10:19). Of course, most of the words listed in the King James vocabulary are ones that appear only in the biblical quotations, some of which are now totally obsolete for virtually all speakers of the language (examples like <span class="italic">besom, carbuncle, cockatrice, ephah, homer, plowshare, rearward, roe, silverling, stomacher, tabret, </span>and<span class="italic"> teil</span>). This section is followed by one that lists all the King James names that occur in the biblical quotations (both literal and phrasal), beginning with king Ahaz (mentioned 5&#160;times in the Book of Mormon text) and ending with Zechariah (the son of Jeberechiah). Some names of special linguistic interest in the Book of Mormon text include <span class="italic">Gilgal, Lucifer, Manasseh, Midian, Palestina, Ramah, </span>and<span class="italic"> Tarshish.</span></p>
			<p class="Normal">The final section of part 5, informally referred to as the collation, lines up the 36 biblical quotations in the Book of Mormon against their corresponding King James passages. This section takes up 143 pages. Just prior to this long section, there is a short description of the three types of textual distinctions that are identified in the comparison:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-22">Δ&#9;the textual difference does not involve italics</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-23"><span class="italic">i</span>&#9;King James italicized words are changed in the Book of Mormon</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-24">x&#9;King James italicized words are unchanged in the Book of Mormon</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">This brief introduction to the collation provides examples from the 36&#160;quotations showing how the symbols are to be applied. Then follows the collation for the 36&#160;quotations, as in this example:</p>
			<p class="•subhead--1- ParaOverride-25"><span class="italic">&#9;&#9;The Book of Mormon&#9;&#9;The King James Bible</span></p>

			<p class="Normal ParaOverride-28">&#9;and thy brow brass&#9;and thy brow brass</p>
			<p class="Normal">In concluding the first half of this paper, which deals with part&#160;5 of volume&#160;3, it is worth reviewing the findings of the previous parts&#160;1–4 and noting those ways in which the Book of Mormon text dates more to Early Modern English than to Joseph Smith’s own times:</p>
			<p class="example-lines"><span class="italic">Grammatical Variation,</span> parts 1 and 2</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">The nonstandard English is found in Early Modern English, in academic and scholarly texts, from the 1500s and 1600s.</p>
			<p class="example-lines"><span class="italic">The Nature of the Original Language, </span>parts 3 and 4</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">The word meanings, phrases, and expressions date from the 1530s through the 1730s.</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-30">&#9;The syntax dates mostly from the second half of the 1500s and the early 1600s. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">To these findings, we now add the scriptural language, which also dates from the 1500s and 1600s:</p>
			<p class="example-lines"><span class="italic">The King James Quotations in the Book of Mormon,</span> part&#160;5</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">With only one exception, all the biblical quotations and paraphrases come from the King James Bible. The single exception is a phrase in 2 Nephi 12:16 (~ Isaiah 2:16), “and upon all the ships of the sea”, which is found in Miles Coverdale’s 1535 Bible (“upon all ships of the sea”).</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">&#9;Based on the substantive differences in the various printings of the King James Bible, the copytext for the biblical quotations and paraphrases dates after the 1660s, but not more precisely.</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">&#9;The influence of the King James italics appears to play a role for 15&#160;instances of the linking <span class="italic">be</span> verb, but its overall influence is restricted since 54&#160;instances of the linking <span class="italic">is</span> are not deleted.</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">&#9;The more paraphrases we include as quotations, the worse the influence of italics on variation in the biblical quotations. This loss of influence is a good reason for accepting as literal quotations only those with strings of 16 or more identical words.</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-30">&#9;The numerous examples of mistranslation and cultural translation in the King James literal quotations almost always date from the 1500s and 1600s, and it is not likely that they derive from the original language on the plates. This finding argues that the Book of Mormon translation is not always a literal translation, but is sometimes a creative and cultural translation, one that can be dependent upon Early Modern English sources rather than ancient ones.</p>
			<p class="Normal ParaOverride-31">With respect to the last point, there are also word uses within the Book of Mormon text proper that argue for a later, nonliteral translation of what would have been on the plates. Here are two examples:</p>
			<p class="example-lines"><span class="italic">a judgment bar</span></p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">In the Book of Mormon, the noun <span class="italic">bar</span> consistently refers to the bar of judgment that we will stand in front of, before the Lord, on&#160;the day of judgment. The judgment bar is not a biblical or ancient term, but instead dates from medieval times. The Oxford &#173;English Dictionary lists this striking example from a sermon by John Wycliffe, dating from around 1375: “Ech man mote nedis stonde <span class="Minion-bold">at þe barre </span>bifore Crist” (that is, “each man must needs stand <span class="Minion-bold">at the bar </span>before Christ”). The Bible refers to standing before the judgment seat of a judge or the throne of a king, as does the Book of Mormon itself when referring to secular judgment. But the Book of Mormon goes further and refers to the “bar of God” and to the future day of judgment. However, the question arises concerning how this would have been expressed on the plates. I&#160;suppose the authors of the words on the plates could have been told, by inspiration, to write a word equivalent to <span class="italic">bar,</span> the word that would be used in the future to refer to the judgment bar of God and to God’s final judgment. But note that the noun <span class="italic">bar</span> is never used anachronistically within the Book of Mormon text itself to refer to a secular judgment, but is consistently used to refer to the final day of judgment. So rather than the equivalent for the word <span class="italic">bar</span> occurring on the plates, it is more likely that the translator(s) decided to use the word <span class="italic">bar</span> (and on two places in the text the more specific <span class="italic">pleading bar,</span> which clearly dates from the 1600s) to refer to the final judgment, a scene then that would have been fully understood by Early Modern English readers and today’s readers, but not by ancient readers.</p>
			<p class="example-lines"><span class="italic">the Bible as a collective singular</span></p>
			<p class="double-indent">In only one passage in the Book of Mormon, in 2 Nephi 29, does the text adopt the word <span class="italic">Bible</span> to refer to the scriptures, and there it is consistently used 11&#160;times in the singular:</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-32">verse 3&#9;and because my words shall hiss forth,<br />&#9;many of the Gentiles shall say:<br />&#9;A <span class="Minion-bold">Bible</span>, a <span class="Minion-bold">Bible</span>, we have got a <span class="Minion-bold">Bible</span>!<br />&#9;And there cannot be any more <span class="Minion-bold">Bible</span>!</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-33">verse 4&#9;O fools, they shall have a <span class="Minion-bold">Bible</span>,<br />&#9;and it shall proceed forth from the Jews,<br />&#9;mine ancient covenant people.<br />&#9;And what thank they the Jews for the <span class="Minion-bold">Bible</span><br />&#9;which they receive from them?</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-33">verse 6&#9;Thou fool that shall say:<br />&#9;A <span class="Minion-bold">Bible</span>, we have got a <span class="Minion-bold">Bible</span>,<br />&#9;and we need no more <span class="Minion-bold">Bible</span>!<br />&#9;Have ye obtained a <span class="Minion-bold">Bible</span><br />&#9;save it were by the Jews?</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-33">verse 10&#9;Wherefore because that ye have a <span class="Minion-bold">Bible</span>,<br />&#9;ye need not suppose that it contains all my words;<br />&#9;neither need ye suppose<br />&#9;that I have not caused more to be written.</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">This passage is referring to how people will react to the Book of Mormon when it is published, and of course the word <span class="italic">Bible,</span> used in the singular as a collective, would be the familiar term at that time. But elsewhere in the Book of Mormon, the prophets do not use the word <span class="italic">Bible </span>since that is not their term; instead, the scriptures are referred to as the record of the Jews:</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-34">1 Nephi 13:23 (the angel speaking to Nephi)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-7">&#9;The book which thou beholdest is <span class="Minion-bold">a record of the Jews</span>,<br />&#9;which contain the covenants of the Lord<br />&#9;which he hath made unto the house of Israel.</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph">Mormon 7:8 (Mormon speaking to modern-day readers)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-33">&#9;Therefore repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus<br />&#9;and lay hold upon the gospel of Christ,<br />&#9;which shall be set before you,<br />&#9;not only in this record but also in <span class="Minion-bold">the record</span><br />&#9;which shall come unto the Gentiles <span class="Minion-bold">from the Jews</span>,<br />&#9;which record shall come from the Gentiles unto you.</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-30">In the Bible itself, the Jewish and Christian scriptures are rarely referred to as a unit or collective whole, but when they are, the text uses the plural <span class="italic">biblia</span> ‘books’, as in 1 Maccabees 12:9: “the holy books of scripture” (the King James translation of <span class="italic">ta biblia ta hagia</span> ‘the holy books’). According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the early Christian father Origin (living in the first half of the third century CE) also used the plural <span class="italic">biblia</span> to refer to the scriptures, but for him the term meant both the Old and the New Testaments together. Yet early on in the Christian era the word <span class="italic">biblia</span> was re-interpreted as a singular, especially in its usage in the early Romance languages. The Book of Mormon itself avoids using the word <span class="italic">Bible</span> except for when it needs to describe how people will react to its publication in Joseph Smith’s time. Thus it seems unlikely that Nephi would have written the word <span class="italic">Bible</span> in his record written in the sixth century BCE. Again, the Book of Mormon supplies the appropriate translation, one that lexically dates the English to medieval times or later. (This nonancient use of the word <span class="italic">Bible</span> was first suggested by Todd Giberson, identified as “Central Texan” on &lt;wordpress@interpreterfoundation.org&gt; on January 29, 2020.)</p>
			<p class="Normal">Word examples like <span class="italic">bar</span> and <span class="italic">Bible</span> argue that the English translation of the Book of Mormon depends on words that first showed up in medieval English. This finding implies that these words did not appear as such on the plates themselves and were therefore introduced into the text during the translation process. But this does not mean that the entire translation of the Book of Mormon is paraphrastic or that it was a fiction created by the Lord. My own personal experience with the text has convinced me that the Book of Mormon is the history of real people and describes real events that occurred in their lives, but at the same time the text also shows the direct influence of the translation process.</p>
			<p class="Normal">It is important to realize that the overall text of the Book of Mormon proper (excluding the quotations from biblical sources) could very well represent a literal translation despite various cases of cultural translation. Examples like the construct genitive in “plates of brass”, “rod of iron”, and “altar of stones”, with its use of the <span class="italic">of</span>-genitive in English (never <span class="italic">brass plates, iron rod, </span>or <span class="italic">stone altar</span>), argue for a Hebrew-like literalness. And there are the literalisms in the original text like the extra <span class="italic">and</span> after an interrupted subordinate clause and before the main clause, as originally in Moroni 10:4: “and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart with real intent—having faith in Christ—<span class="Minion-bold">and</span> he will manifest the truth of it unto you”. And then there are the specific Book of Mormon names, ones that Joseph Smith controlled for and spelled out letter for letter to his scribe (examples like <span class="italic">Coriantumr</span> and <span class="italic">Zenoch</span>).</p>
			<p class="Normal">We have a similar situation with the King James Bible, which is basically a literal translation of the original Hebrew (and the occasional Aramaic) for the Old Testament and of the original Greek for the New Testament. But there are all these individual exceptions, some of them noted in KJQ, such as the cultural translations of <span class="italic">candle</span> in place of <span class="italic">lamp </span>and<span class="italic"> dry-shod</span> instead of the phrase “in sandals”. Another example is the King James phrase “to sit at meat” or “to sit at table”, a cultural, creative translation for the original Greek “to recline (at meal or at table)”, that dates back to William Tyndale’s 1526 translation of the New Testament. Jesus indeed ate the last supper with his disciples, but not as Leonardo da Vinci portrayed it, sitting around a table (or on only one side of a long table). We still believe the last supper occurred, even though the Bible translators from the 1500s and 1600s typically translated the text this way, culturally and creatively, as “sitting at meal”. </p>
			<p class="•subhead--1-"><span class="Minion-bold">Part 6, </span><span class="Minion-bold-italic">Spelling in the Manuscripts and Editions</span><span class="Minion-bold"> (SPL)</span></p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">For the second half of this paper, we take up a more mundane subject, how the scribes misspelled words in the manuscripts. Here we will consider three issues: </p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-7">Was orthography still indeterminate in the early 1800s?<br />How good were the Book of Mormon scribes?<br />What can spelling tell us about the Book of Mormon text? </p>
			<p class="Normal">The first chapter of part&#160;6, entitled “Misunderstanding Spelling Variation in the Book of Mormon”, deals with an article that has had an inordinate influence on how Latter-day Saints have understood misspellings in the Book of Mormon manuscripts and in the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, namely, George Horton’s “Understanding Textual Changes in the Book of Mormon”, published in the LDS Church’s <span class="italic">Ensign</span> in December, 1983. Despite Horton’s implicit claim in the title of his article that he will undertake to explain “textual changes”, he virtually ignores the subject and instead devotes most of the article to the largely irrelevant question of spelling variation in the early text of the Book of Mormon. Here I will refer to several provocative statements of Horton’s that are essentially false in every respect and have not been helpful to Latter-day Saints trying to deal with the issue of changes in the text of the Book of Mormon.</p>
			<p class="subhead2">(1) Horton: “the spelling in the first edition was Oliver Cowdery’s”</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">The first page of the printer’s manuscript (P), written down by Oliver Cowdery (OC), when compared against the spellings that show up in the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon (set from P by the typesetter, John Gilbert), shows that this statement is completely false:</p>
			<p class="example-lines">P (OC)&#9;1830 edition (Gilbert)&#9;frequency</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">&#9;cours&#9;course&#9;2</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">&#9;haveing&#9;having&#9;5</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">&#9;knowledg&#9;knowledge&#9;1</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">&#9;procedings&#9;proceedings&#9;1</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">&#9;prophits&#9;prophets&#9;1</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">&#9;destroid&#9;destroyed&#9;1</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent ParaOverride-9">&#9;excedingly&#9;exceedingly&#9;1</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">One wonders how Horton could have gotten this claim of his so wrong. It didn’t come from examining photographs of P (which by the early 1980s were available in microfilm in BYU library’s special collections). Perhaps he was misled by this account from John Gilbert of the printing of the 1830 edition (produced by Gilbert himself in typescript in 1892):</p>
			<p class="•quote-5-5-no-indent">On the second day – Harris and Smith being in the office – I called their attention to a grammatical error, and asked whether I should correct it ? Harris consulted with Smith a short time, and turned to me and said; “The Old Testament is ungrammatical, set it as it is written.”</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">The phrase at the end, “set it as it is written”, could be mistaken to mean ‘set the text from P, exactly as it is written’. But Gilbert was not referring to the spelling of words, but rather to correcting the nonstandard grammar in the text. He was expected to standardize the spellings as he set the type for the first edition, which he did (as we can see from the misspellings he corrected as he set the very first page of P).</p>
			<p class="subhead2">(2) Horton: “Consider, too, that the two distinct words <span class="roman">strait</span> and <span class="roman">straight</span> would sound exactly the same as Joseph dictated it. But Oliver spelled both words <span class="roman">straight</span> every time.”</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Actually, Oliver Cowdery used the spelling <span class="italic">strait</span> for both these words, with only one exception in extant portions of the original manuscript&#160;(O) and none in the virtually extant printer’s manuscript (P):</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-35">in O&#9;9 times <span class="italic">strait,</span> 1 time <span class="italic">straight</span><br />in P&#9;23 times <span class="italic">strait</span></p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">On the other hand, John Gilbert used the spelling <span class="italic">straight</span> for both words, all 27&#160;times. (Oliver Cowdery wrote only 23&#160;instances of <span class="italic">strait</span> in P; the four other instances were in the hand of scribe&#160;2 of P, and they were also spelled <span class="italic">strait</span>.) So neither the scribe in P nor the typesetter for the 1830 edition made any distinction between these two words that sounded exactly the same. But this is just the opposite of what Horton claimed. Again, he was apparently following his first claim that the 1830 spellings were Oliver Cowdery’s.</p>
			<p class="subhead2">(3) Horton: “American English spelling in 1829 was not yet standardized.” </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">This represents Horton’s most egregious claim, one that is frequently quoted to me by Latter-day Saints. During the second half of the 1700s, English spelling in both Britain and America became more or less standardized, largely the result of Samuel Johnson’s <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the English Language,</span> published in two volumes in 1755 in London. Following its publication, there were various one-volume versions of Johnson’s dictionary, usually with pronunciation added but always without Johnson’s citations from well-known British writers (Johnson’s “authorities”). These abridged versions were consulted by printers whenever they needed to check the spelling of a word. Thus the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon was set in standard spelling, with only a few exceptions.</p>
			<p class="Normal">So where does Horton get his claim that American English spelling had not been standardized when the 1830 edition was set? It obviously didn’t come from looking at an actual 1830 edition or a facsimile of it (which would have been readily available). Instead, it came from Horton’s misreading of page&#160;37 of Noah Webster’s introduction to his 1828 <span class="italic">An American Dictionary of the English Language,</span> as we shall see below.</p>
			<p class="subhead2">(4) Horton: “As late as 1828, American lexicographer Noah Webster noted that five dictionaries were available to him. Examples from four of those dictionaries show the variations in spellings commonly accepted at the time Oliver was taking dictation from the Prophet.”</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Horton then provides the following “variations in spellings” from page&#160;37 of Webster’s introduction to his dictionary:</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-36"><span class="italic">Sheridan &#9;Walker&#9;Perry&#9;Jameson<br /></span>1784 &#9;1794&#9;1805&#9;1827</p>
			<p class="double-indent">creatshur&#9;cretshure&#9;creature&#9;creture</p>
			<p class="double-indent">scriptshur&#9;scriptshur&#9;scripture&#9;scriptyur</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-37">claushure &#9;clauzhure&#9;clauzhure&#9;chauzhur</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">But these “spellings” for <span class="italic">creature, scripture,</span> and <span class="italic">closure</span> are actually pronunciations. In fact, the actual spellings for all of these words agree with Webster’s and are all standard. We can see this by consulting these dictionaries. I was able to find three of these dictionaries online, and we get the following spellings and associated pronunciations for each of the dictionaries:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-38">Thomas Sheridan, <span class="italic">A General Dictionary of the English Language </span>(London: William Strachan, 1780)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-22">Creature &#9;kre-t∫hur</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-22">Scripture&#9;skrip-t∫hur</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-22">Closure&#9;klo-zhur</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-38">John Walker, <span class="italic">A Critical Pronouncing Dictionary and Expositor of the English Language </span>(London: G.&#160;Robinson, 1794)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-22">Creature&#9;kre-t∫hure</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-22">Scripture&#9;skrip-t∫hure</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-22">Closure&#9;klo-zhure</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-38">R. S. Jameson, <span class="italic">Dictionary of the English Language </span>(London: W. Pickering, 1828)</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-22">Creature&#9;kre-ture</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-22">Scripture&#9;skript-yur</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-37">Closure&#9;klo-zhur</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">So what misled Horton here? Perhaps it was Webster’s last sentence before he provided the list of pronunciations for five dictionaries (on page&#160;37):</p>
			<p class="•quote-5-5-no-indent">In the orthography, I have given the letters used by each author, in the syllable which contains the difference of pronunciation; in the others, I&#160;have followed the common orthography.</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">In some cases, Webster does give the common orthography for the pronunciation, as he states. But the list is also full of pronunciations, which are not spellings. Apparently, Horton didn’t read the preceding five pages of Webster; otherwise, he would have realized that Webster was complaining about how these five dictionaries had treated the pronunciation for words (Webster’s dictionary was superior, by far, or so he thought).</p>
			<p class="subhead2">(5) Horton: “It is not surprising, then, that many words in the Book of Mormon would need to be corrected as American English spelling became more uniform later in the nineteenth century.”</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Finally, we have Horton’s conclusion, which is doubly false. First of all, the 1830 edition was already in standard orthography; it is not true that “many words would need to be corrected” in subsequent editions. And second, the standard orthography for American spelling is already basically determined by this time; it will not become “more uniform” as the nineteenth century progresses.</p>
			<p class="Normal">In the next chapter of part&#160;6, entitled “The Manuscripts and Their Scribes”, I turn to the question of good and bad spellers in the manuscripts. We get the following results for the scribes, along with John Gilbert, the typesetter for the 1830 edition. I have also tentatively identified scribes&#160;2 and 3 in O as well as scribe&#160;2 of P; in part&#160;7 of volume&#160;3, I will provide the evidence that supports these identifications. I mark these three scribes as tentative (but to different degrees), indicating each with an arrow:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-39"><span class="italic">first-rate speller</span></p>

			<p class="Normal-no-indent">This spelling improvement is very likely the result of Oliver Cowdery’s proofing of the 1830 typeset sheets against the manuscript. Every so often, while proofing, Oliver would realize that his nonstandard spelling for a word differed from the typesetter’s standard spelling, and from then on in his copywork for P he would use the correct spelling. Here are some examples of the spellings that Oliver learned to spell during the printing process. For each word, I give the statistics for his spellings in both manuscripts, and in each case his corrected spelling and his original incorrect spelling. Finally, in the last column, I indicate where Oliver in his copywork for P switched to the correct spelling; the words are listed in the order in which Oliver learned to spell them correctly in P:</p>

			<p class="Normal">In analyzing scribal errors, it is important to differentiate between several types of errors. The most prominent type of scribal error would be a misspelling, which is any spelling of a word that would be pronounced the same as the standard spelling of that word. Thus the spelling <span class="italic">boddy</span> counts as a misspelling since it is not the standard spelling, <span class="italic">body,</span> but it would be pronounced the same as the standard spelling. Under this definition of misspelling, spelling variants do not count as misspellings. For the Book of Mormon scribes, writing in the early 1800s, this would include spelling variants like <span class="italic">centre, enquire, journied, sayeth, saviour, </span>and <span class="italic">sea shore. </span>All of these were acceptable spellings in the early 1800s in America (and some are still today).</p>
			<p class="Normal">In distinction to misspellings, we have spelling slips, examples like <span class="italic">concening, ome </span>[<span class="italic">one</span>], <span class="italic">woice, Nindred, </span>and <span class="italic">Nepi.</span> For cases of slippage, the scribe accidentally omits, adds, or miswrites a letter in a word (and sometimes more than one letter), so that the resulting spelling is not pronounceable like the standard spelling for the word.</p>
			<p class="Normal">A third type of scribal error is where there is an obvious slip in the substantives, that is, where there is an easily recognizable error in the actual words of the text rather than in the spelling of those words. Here are three instances that Martin Harris (scribe 2 of P) produced when he was copying from O into P:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-14">in my shall they called (Mosiah 26:18)<br />&#9;“in my<span class="Minion-bold"> name</span> shall they<span class="Minion-bold"> be</span> called”</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-15">the <span class="Minion-bold">number Number </span>of the slain (Alma 3:1)<br />&#9;“the number of the slain”</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">In the first example, there are two omissions of words: the noun <span class="italic">name</span> and the auxiliary verb <span class="italic">be.</span> In the second example, the word <span class="italic">number</span> was written twice. Any scribe, including Martin, would have recognized these errors, if only he had briefly looked over what he had written.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Finally, a slip in the substantives can make a textual difference, one that seems like a perfectly acceptable reading but cannot be recognized unless the scribe (or a proofreader) checks his copytext. In cases like these, without the copytext, we may think that the scribe has done a good job of copying, when in fact the resulting copy may be full of unrecognizable substantive slips, such as these slips that Oliver Cowdery made when he copied from O into P, all in 1&#160;Nephi:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-7">wherefore <span class="Minion-bold">I cried &gt; did cry </span>unto the Lord (1 Nephi 2:16)<br />he did provide <span class="Minion-bold">ways and means &gt; means </span>for us (1 Nephi 17:3)<br />to be cast <span class="Minion-bold">with sorrow &gt;</span><span class="Minion-bold CharOverride-5"> null</span><span class="Minion-bold"> </span>into a watery grave (1 Nephi 18:18)<br />thou hast <span class="Minion-bold">heard and seen &gt; seen and heard </span>all this (1 Nephi 20:6)<br />being <span class="Minion-bold">nursed &gt; nourished </span>by the Gentiles (1 Nephi 22:8)</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">For these examples, O is still extant, and thus we can discover the errors that Oliver made. Without O, we would have no idea in any of these cases that the resulting P was incorrect. And that is one reason why all of these errors except the one in 1 Nephi 18:18 involving the loss of the phrase “with sorrow” have persisted in the standard LDS text of the Book of Mormon.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Thus, in order to fully analyze the slips the Book of Mormon scribes made, either in taking down Joseph Smith’s dictation (the original manuscript, O) or in copying the text (the printer’s manuscript, P), we need the copytext. Of course, we do not have any direct record of what Joseph saw in his translation instrument or of what he dictated to the scribes. And in the case of copying from O into P, most of O is not extant (72&#160;percent). These two factors make it difficult to determine all the scribal slips that led to substantive differences in the text, so in this analysis of the scribal slips we will include only the obvious slips in the substantives, errors that the scribe should have caught by simply re-reading what he had just written down. This will allow for a fair comparison in assessing each scribe’s ability to avoid scribal slips because for most of the scribal transmission we do not have the copytext for the scribe. (All these substantive scribal slips, that is, any slips not readily recognizable as errors in the scribe’s copy, will be considered in part 7 of volume 3 of the critical text, <span class="italic">From the Manuscripts Through the Editions.</span>)</p>
			<p class="Normal">We therefore calculate the rate of scribal slips by combining the two kinds of obvious slips, ones that the scribe should have caught and corrected from viewing his copy alone: (1)&#160;slips in the spelling of words, and (2)&#160;slips in the substantives (the words). Equivalently, for a typesetter we can calculate all his typos, either in the spelling of individual words or in obvious errors in typesetting the words of the text. For all the secondary manuscript scribes and, at the end, for the 1830 typesetter, we get the following rates of scribal slips (errors per thousand words):</p>

			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Christian Whitmer and Hyrum Smith not only had high rates of misspelling, but they also had high rates of scribal slippage, especially Hyrum. Both Martin Harris and John Whitmer also had fairly high rates of scribal slips; and Martin’s scribal slippage remained fairly constant over time. Of course, the 1830 typesetter made relatively few typos compared to the slips the scribes made.</p>
			<p class="Normal">When we consider the rate of slips for Oliver Cowdery, the main scribe in both O and P, we discover that he had a consistently low rate of scribal slips:</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent ParaOverride-43"><span class="Minion-Semibold-italic CharOverride-4">scribe&#9;source&#9;sampling&#9;dateerror rate</span></p>

			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Of course, we do not expect scribal slippage to improve over time. Thus Martin Harris’s rate was about 10 per thousand words, while Oliver Cowdery averaged a low rate of about 2 per thousand words.</p>
			<p class="Normal">There are three factors, then, that lead us to evaluate Oliver Cowdery as a first-rate scribe, especially in comparison to all the other scribes:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-50">(1) his rate of scribal slips is consistently low</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-51">(2) his spelling improves over time</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-52">(3) he writes with the clearest and smoothest hand (by far)</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">I have not mentioned this third factor, clarity of the hand, until now. When I was transcribing the scribes’ words as part of my initial work on the manuscripts (in 1988), I was always relieved when the scribe switched to Oliver Cowdery. All the other scribes were very difficult to transcribe, especially since I needed to make sure of what they had actually intended to write; and as a result, it would usually take about three times longer to transcribe any given line in their hand than if it were in Oliver’s hand. I could always deal with Oliver’s misspellings. It was the scribal slips (along will ill-formed letters) that caused the real difficulties in transcribing the manuscripts, and fortunately that was never a particular problem with Oliver.</p>
			<p class="Normal">The final chapter of part&#160;6 is an extensive 455-page analysis of all the misspellings in the manuscripts as well as the spelling variants in the printed editions of the Book of Mormon. Most of the sections in this chapter are organized according to phonemes (that is, sounds), as in this listing found under the spellings for the phoneme /p/:</p>
			<p class="example-lines">Misspellings of /p/</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-4">&#9;in the manuscripts:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-53"><span class="italic">&#9;&#9;p &gt; pp</span>&#9;<span class="italic">opperation, opperate; sepparateth; uppon</span></p>

			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-53">&#9;&#9;variation for <span class="italic">p ~ pp&#9;worshiped ~ worshipped<br />worshiping ~ worshipping<br />worshipers ~ worshippers</span></p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Near the end, there are a few sections dealing with the spelling of certain graphemes (that is, letters), such as silent <span class="italic">e</span> and the letter <span class="italic">x</span>. And to conclude this entire analysis, there is an index of all the words in the analysis, organized according to their standard spellings.</p>
			<p class="Normal">Given all this analysis of the misspellings, one may reasonably ask: “Can there any good thing come out of misspellings?” One purpose of part&#160;6, dedicated entirely to the spellings in the manuscripts and the editions, is to show the numerous ways in which spelling issues have had an important impact in the critical text project of the Book of Mormon. Here are some of the things that spellings errors can tell us:</p>
			<p class="nonheading">(1) how Joseph Smith or his scribes pronounced names</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-4"><span class="italic">Amalickiah</span> was consistently pronounced with stress on the first syllable, not the second, probably by Joseph Smith as he dictated the text.</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-4"><span class="italic">Melchizedek</span> was pronounced as <span class="italic">Melchezidek,</span> with a switch in the second and third vowels. This is the pronunciation generally used by today’s speakers of English, including those in the LDS Church.</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-23">Joseph Smith pronounced <span class="italic">Mosiah</span> identically to <span class="italic">Messiah </span>(with an <span class="italic">s</span> rather than a <span class="italic">z</span>). Either pronunciation for <span class="italic">Mosiah </span>(with either an <span class="italic">s</span> or a <span class="italic">z</span>) still occurs among speakers in the LDS Church.</p>
			<p class="nonheading">(2) various dialectal pronunciations for the scribes</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-4">Oliver Cowdery (scribe 1 in O and in P)</p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="italic">grievous&#9;grievious</span>&#9;with an extra /i/ before the -<span class="italic">ous</span></p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="italic">height</span>&#9;<span class="italic">heighth</span>&#9;plus the nominalizing suffix /θ/</p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="italic">obliged</span>&#9;<span class="italic">oblidged</span>&#9;the /<span class="TNR">ɪ</span>/ vowel rather than /ai/</p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="italic">wage</span>&#9;<span class="italic">wedge</span>&#9;the /<span class="TNR">ɛ</span>/ vowel rather than /ei/</p>
			<p class="example-lines">Martin Harris (scribe 2 of P)</p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="italic">deaf&#9;deef</span>&#9;the /i/ vowel rather than /<span class="TNR">ɛ</span>/</p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="italic">scroll&#9;scrawl</span>&#9;the /<span class="TNR">ɔ</span>/ vowel rather than /ou/</p>
			<p class="example-lines">Christian Whitmer (scribe 3 of O)</p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="italic">Nazareth&#9;nathareth</span>&#9;with /ð/ rather than the standard /<span class="italic">z</span>/</p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="italic">obliged</span>&#9;<span class="italic">oblieged</span>&#9;the /i/ vowel rather than /ai/</p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="italic">spacious</span>&#9;<span class="italic">specious</span>&#9;the /<span class="TNR">ɛ</span>/ vowel rather than /ei/</p>
			<p class="example-lines">John Whitmer (scribe 2 of O)</p>
			<p class="double-indent"><span class="italic">spacious</span>&#9;<span class="italic">specious</span>&#9;the /<span class="TNR">ɛ</span>/ vowel rather than /ei/</p>
			<p class="nonheading ParaOverride-39">(3) a word’s pronunciation sometimes led to a scribal error</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-4">The verb <span class="italic">scourge</span> was apparently pronounced as “scorge” by both Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery rather than as “scurge”, today’s standard pronunciation. Oliver’s typical misspelling of <span class="italic">scourge</span>(<span class="italic">d</span>) in P and extant O was <span class="italic">scorge</span>(<span class="italic">d</span>), in 9 out of 22&#160;cases. Thus the only difference between <span class="italic">scorched</span> and <span class="italic">scourged</span> would have been voicing: “scorched” versus “scorged”. This is probably why Oliver Cowdery misheard the original <span class="italic">scorched</span> in Mosiah 17:13 as <span class="italic">scourged:</span></p>
			<p class="double-indent">Mosiah 17:13–14</p>
			<p class="sub-paragraph ParaOverride-14">and it came to pass that they took him and bound him<br />and <span class="Minion-bold">scorched</span> [dictated] &gt; <span class="Minion-bold">scorged</span> [misheard] &gt; <span class="Minion-bold">scourged</span><br />his skin with fagots / yea even unto death<br />and now when the flames began to <span class="Minion-bold">scorch</span> him<br />he cried unto them saying&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
			<p class="nonheading">(4) the written form in O was misread by Oliver Cowdery when he copied it into P, especially when the scribe in O was not Oliver</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-4">four examples from other scribes of O:</p>
			<p class="double-indent">Christian Whitmer’s <span class="italic">pr</span><span class="italic">∫</span><span class="italic">sing</span> &gt; Oliver Cowdery’s <span class="italic">feeling, </span>in 1&#160;Nephi 8:31</p>

			<p class="nonheading">(8) archaic spellings can make understanding difficult</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">The weapon <span class="italic">scimitar </span>is consistently spelled <span class="italic">cimeter</span> in the 1830 edition (compare this with Noah Webster’s 1828 dictionary spelling <span class="italic">cimiter</span>). Databases show that both <span class="italic">cimeter</span> and <span class="italic">scimitar</span> occurred with equal probability in the early 1800s, but by 1900 <span class="italic">cimeter</span> had become obsolete; yet it is still in the standard text of the Book of Mormon. Most readers will wonder what this <span class="italic">cimeter</span> is.</p>
			<p class="nonheading">(9) detecting forgeries, especially in the University of Chicago acquisition (Alma 3–5), dating from the early 1980s and intending to be in Oliver Cowdery’s hand</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">This forgery (covering four pages of the original manuscript, supposedly) has unique spellings, ones that the scribes never used: <span class="italic">forheads, thruout, Morman, </span>and<span class="italic"> gilt </span>[<span class="italic">guilt</span>].</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">&#9;This document also has the spelling <span class="italic">reccord</span> for <span class="italic">record,</span> yet that spelling was never used by Oliver Cowdery; in P and in extant O, he used <span class="italic">reckord</span> 12 times and <span class="italic">record </span>181 times. However, Alma 3–5 in the printer’s manuscript is in the hand of Martin Harris and Hyrum Smith; and there Martin wrote the misspelling <span class="italic">reccord</span> once and Hyrum twice.</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">&#9;These four pages have three instances of <span class="italic">and</span> actually written out as <span class="italic">and.</span> Yet Oliver Cowdery never wrote <span class="italic">and</span> in this way in either manuscript: for thousands of occurrences he wrote <span class="italic">and</span> as an ampersand, &amp;; and for hundreds of occurrences, at the beginning of a sentence or a chapter, he wrote <span class="italic">And.</span> Only two times did Oliver write <span class="italic">and, </span>but in both those cases the initial <span class="italic">a</span> was simply an enlarged <span class="italic">a,</span> written that way to overwrite an earlier miswriting of Oliver’s. On the other hand, Martin Harris and Hyrum Smith both used &amp; and <span class="italic">and</span> in their copywork. It looks like the copytext for this forgery was the printer’s manuscript!</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">&#9;In part 6, I discuss at some length two of these inappropriate spellings: <span class="italic">thruout </span>and <span class="italic">reccord;</span> all of these unexpected spellings will be discussed in part 8 of volume 3 when I analyze all of the known forged fragments of the original manuscript.</p>
			<p class="nonheading">(10) the spelling out of Book of Mormon names in O</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">There is striking evidence in the original manuscript for Oliver Cowdery initially writing a name phonetically, then immediately revising that spelling, apparently the result of Joseph Smith spelling out that name for him. Three examples are thoroughly discussed in part 6:</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-7"><span class="italic">&#9;&#9;Zenock &gt; Zenoch</span> (Alma 33:15)<br />&#9;&#9;<span class="italic">Ameleckiah &gt; Amalickiah</span> (Alma 46:5)<br />&#9;&#9;<span class="italic">Coriantummer &gt; Coriantumr</span> (Helaman 1:15)</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">Known biblical names are never spelled out, but there is one potential biblical name that is corrected, <span class="italic">Gilgal.</span> In Ether 13:27 of O, Oliver Cowdery initially wrote “in the valley of <span class="Minion-bold">Gilgall</span>”, which he later corrected (with distinctly heavier ink flow) from <span class="italic">Gilgall </span>to <span class="italic">Gilgal</span>. It is unlikely that Oliver recognized <span class="italic">Gilgal </span>as biblical, thus it was spelled out to him. Although biblical names were not typically spelled out, if necessary they could have been.</p>
			<p class="nonheading">(11) the spelling out of common words of English</p>
			<p class="double-indent ParaOverride-29">In part 6, I also discuss the issue of whether Joseph Smith ever spelled out actual English words (as Emma Smith claimed in one of her accounts of the translation process). There seems to be one extant example in O where this might have occurred, in 1 Nephi 5:14 where Christian Whitmer misspelled his first instance of <span class="italic">genealogy</span> as <span class="italic">jenealeja,</span> but then spelled his subsequent instances of the word correctly. This difference suggests that Joseph might have correctly spelled out this word to Christian when he had to write it a second time. But this is the only example we have in extant portions of O where this kind of spelling out of difficult English words might have occurred.</p>
			<p class="nonheading">(12) names that Oliver Cowdery, for no apparent reason, changed the spelling of when he copied the text from O into P</p>
			<p class="example-lines ParaOverride-15">&#9;&#9;<span class="italic">Am(e)licites</span> <span class="italic">&gt; Amalekites</span><br />&#9;&#9;<span class="italic">Gaddianton</span> &gt; <span class="italic">Gadianton</span><br />&#9;&#9;<span class="italic">Kishcumen</span> &gt; <span class="italic">Kishkumen</span><br />&#9;&#9;<span class="italic">Morionton</span> &gt; <span class="italic">Morianton</span><br />&#9;&#9;<span class="italic">Pa(r)horon</span> &gt; <span class="italic">Pahoran</span></p>
			<p class="example-comment ParaOverride-59">Oliver did not make the change from <span class="italic">Amlicites</span> to <span class="italic">Amalekites</span> in Alma 2–3, but only for the phonetically closer <span class="italic">Amelicites</span> in Alma 21–43.</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">The more substantive changes in the spelling of words and names will be thoroughly discussed in part&#160;7 of volume&#160;3, <span class="italic">The Transmission of the Text: From the Manuscripts Through the Editions, </span>as well as in part&#160;8, <span class="italic">Textual Criticism of the Book of Mormon</span>. And so on to these next two parts and to the end.</p>
