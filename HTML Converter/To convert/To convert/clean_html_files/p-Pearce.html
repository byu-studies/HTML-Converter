<h1>At least in heaven there’s food.</h1>
<p> <em>after Ghouta</em></p>
<p>She was building bread when</p>
<p>the building was bombed,</p>
<p>a fighter jet or gasoline tank,</p>
<p>kneaded to a flat cake.</p>
<p>Her dough would never take</p>
<p>shape, bake to a crust, be</p>
<p>cut and shared and filled,</p>
<p>wrapped around spiced meat</p>
<p>and veg. Covered in dust</p>
<p>that might have been flour,</p>
<p>her dough was lost in debris,</p>
<p>her world burnt before the timer,</p>
<p>before the plate was even hot,</p>
<p>so her tears score the loaf</p>
<p>of her face, the bleeding</p>
<p>wound of a hungry mother.</p>
<p>	—Jared Pearce</p>
