<h1>She Believed</h1>
<p>She believed her offering was enough,</p>
<p>And it was.</p>
<p>More than enough.</p>
<p>She believed she had in her hands</p>
<p>Enough to feed five thousand,</p>
<p>And there was.</p>
<p>She believed</p>
<p>That what her Savior was in search of</p>
<p>Was her.</p>
<p>She was the one who gave</p>
<p>Just what He needed</p>
<p>To be able to teach</p>
<p>And to save.</p>
<p>She believed</p>
<p>And didn’t doubt.</p>
<p>She had courage</p>
<p>To propose</p>
<p>Amidst the scoffs</p>
<p>And hunger throes—</p>
<p>A brave girl</p>
<p>Believed.</p>
<p>—Sarah Richards Samuelson</p>
