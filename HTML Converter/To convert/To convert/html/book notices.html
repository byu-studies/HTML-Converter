			<p class="notice-title"><span class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor000"></a>By Divine Design: Best Practices for Family Success and Happiness,</span> edited by Brent L. Top and Michael A. Goodman (Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University; Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2014)</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-no-indent">In <span class="italic">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</span>, the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints proclaim that the responsibilities and joys of marriage, parenting, and family life are given to men and women “by divine design.” Using this phrase to set the tone for their edited volume, this book’s editors further subtitle this selection of twelve articles a compendium of “best practices” designed to promote family success and happiness. The edited collection was developed under the guidance of Brent&#160;L. Top, dean of Religious Education and professor of Church history and doctrine, and Michael A. Goodman, associate professor of Church history and doctrine, both of Brigham Young University.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">“Best practices” in fields ranging from education to management refer to principle-&#173;based approaches that are useful, enduring, and meaningful in facilitating growth and success. Many a spouse or parent has wondered how best to resolve an interpersonal conflict or provide helpful support to a family member in times of difficulty. In this volume, the authors were encouraged to draw upon and integrate essential teachings from scripture and prophetic leaders with sound findings from social science to make clear and apply such best practices to family life. The contributors include a range of scholars and educators from marriage, family and human development, sociology, psychology, and religious education at Brigham Young University.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">This collection of twelve articles has been edited carefully, and each chapter presents an accessible, interesting, and practical profile of its family topic, enriched by color photos and relevant summaries of scientific data or gospel-related teachings. The volume opens with a chapter on a common family struggle, seeking harmony in family life in a busy, chaotic world. The next three chapters focus on sustaining a healthy marriage, with articles that address the role of faith and commitment in marriage; time challenges and couple rituals in marriage; and marriage, divorce, and covenant-&#173;keeping in the LDS community. The remaining eight chapters explore multiple dimensions of the parenting experience. One chapter on parenting provides an in-depth discussion of raising children based on the key principles of latitude, limits, and love. Other chapters explore the unique roles of women and men as parents, with one focused on the mothering experience in our modern world and its key contributions, while the other addresses “faithful fathering” and vital elements of how fathers can reach for success in family life. Another chapter explores the transmission of faith to children and best practices in cultivating a healthy religious environment in the home that will bless children. The last four chapters focus on parenting teenagers and young adults, and include explorations of specific and proactive parenting practices for teens, raising teens to overcome selfishness and indulgence, helping young adults transition into the key domains of adult life, and selected parental practices for navigating the challenges of raising “emerging” adults.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">In a world where trustworthy information can be difficult to find, this volume presents a useful compilation that blends spiritual perspectives with sound research findings. If readers are indeed interested in finding “family success and happiness,” this book will provide them with an understanding of contemporary challenges in family life and a broad set of “best practices” that can be understood and applied in strengthening marriage, improving parenting, and enriching family relationships.</p>

			<p class="notice-title"><span class="italic">The First Vision: A Harmonization of 10&#160;Accounts from the Sacred Grove </span>by Matthew B. Christensen (Springville, Utah: Cedar Fort, 2014)</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-no-indent">The First Vision of Joseph Smith is one&#160;of the defining moments in the theology of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. With it began the Restoration of the gospel and the reopening of the communication between God and his children. Even after the contributions of scholars such as &#173;Milton V. Backman, James B. Allen, John W. Welch, and Steven C. Harper, most Latter-&#173;day Saints are familiar with only the canonized account of this vision recorded in Joseph Smith—History in the Pearl of Great Price. However, there are other accounts of it recorded by Joseph Smith as well as other secondary sources.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">In this short book that is also filled with beautiful illustrations, Matthew B. Christensen attempts to do something that many agree is long overdue: harmonize ten different accounts of the First Vision into one comprehensive account. He begins his book by providing certain criteria that helped him decide which accounts he should or should not use in this harmony. Basically, he chose to use only those that were recorded during the lifetime of Joseph Smith, resulting in ten accounts. He then goes on to summarize each of them, briefly discussing their origins, authors, and content. After these summaries, he describes his method of bringing the accounts together into one, and his organizational plan, which is essentially to keep the canonized version as the “core melody,” and to have the other nine accounts as “accompaniment” in the “harmony” (9). He also notes the limitations to such a task, and comments that though he has tried to ensure a fair portrayal of all the accounts, he is aware that there may be some human error evident in the final outcome.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">After these introductory sections, Christensen provides the reader with a color key, which assigns a specific color to each of the different accounts so as to aid the reader when going through the harmony. The next pages contain the harmony itself, and it is in these pages that the reader will be able to read the many different accounts of the First Vision as one flowing version. After this harmony, he offers a short conclusion, including a small section with an invitation from Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon with their promise of a personal witness to the truthfulness of their testimonies.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">Those interested in a better understanding of Joseph Smith’s First Vision, member of the Church or not, will find this an informative read. It offers a new approach to all of the various accounts of&#160;the First Vision and uncovers some of the&#160;lesser-known details and thoughts of Joseph before, during, and after the event. As a result, it is more varied than the canonized version and even includes a section where all of Christ’s words from the different accounts are together at one time. Visitors at the new exhibition in Salt Lake City at the Church History Museum entitled “The Heavens Are Open” will also encounter a shorter but similar harmonization in the dramatic presentation of the First Vision there. </p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">While it is helpful to see the various accounts harmonized as one, readers will also benefit from Christensen’s encouragement that all readers undertake a serious study of all the different accounts separately. <span class="italic">The First Vision</span> is best seen in this light; it is an aid to help curious readers learn and be uplifted by the unified accounts and to encourage them to seek out more involved research about the accounts. Ultimately, <span class="italic">The First Vision</span> is intended to strengthen testimony and show that the different accounts are indeed harmonious and accordant.</p>

			<p class="notice-title"><span class="italic">Ancient Temple Worship: Proceedings of the Expound Symposium, 14&#160;May 2011,</span> edited by Matthew B. Brown, Jeffrey M. Bradshaw, Stephen D. Ricks, and John&#160;S. Thompson (Salt Lake City: The Interpreter Foundation and Eborn Books, 2014)</p>
			<p class="notice-title"><span class="italic">Temple Insights: Proceedings of the Interpreter Matthew B. Brown Memorial Conference: “The Temple on Mount Zion,” 22&#160;September 2012,</span> edited by Matthew B. Brown, William J. Hamblin, and David Rolph Seely (Salt Lake City: The Interpreter Foundation and Eborn Books, 2014)</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-no-indent"><span class="italic">Ancient Temple Worship </span>and <span class="italic">Temple Insights</span> are both compilations of works by various authors and published as proceedings of symposia organized by the late Matthew B. Brown, who was an author and historian writing for the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, the Neal A. Maxwell Institute of Religious Scholarship, and the Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research. Readers that have ever been mystified by temple symbolism, ancient temples, or modern temple worship will find these books helpful in their pursuit of understanding.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">By a thorough analysis of scriptures and historical evidence, <span class="italic">Ancient Temple Worship</span> helps readers make connections between ancient worldviews and temple worship. Topics explore the symbolic meaning of measuring tools, hand gestures, the tabernacle, sacred tree iconography, and the Holy of Holies. The book includes broader topics such as the genetics of indigenous populations and how that relates to the historicity of the Book of Mormon. </p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent"><span class="italic">Temple Insights</span> will enhance &#173;readers’ understanding and appreciation of current temples, but in doing so, readers are treated to a panorama of temple worship throughout time and place. The book stands as a witness that the preexilic Hebrews understood the temple concept to originate with Adam, not Moses, which understanding is reflected in Joseph Smith’s teachings. Articles also provide insights on temple worship by exploring temples in the Book of Mormon. <span class="italic">Temple Insights</span> was dedicated to Matthew B. Brown after his sudden death, which occurred before Brown finished organizing the conference upon which this book is based.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">These two books serve as a fitting dedication to Brown’s love of and appreciation for the temple, along with its symbolism and worship. Brown’s lifelong study and tireless interest in sacred things, which developed into a deep devotion for temple worship, is reflected in the wide-ranging scholarship that the authors undertook in his honor.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">Both books enrich previous Latter-day Saint writings on temple symbolism and worship. Readers are brought up to date on how scholars are interacting with such works as <span class="italic">Temple and Cosmos,</span> <span class="italic">The Message of the Joseph Smith Papyri, Temples in the Ancient World, One Eternal Round,</span> and <span class="italic">Illuminating the Sermon at the Temple and the Sermon on the Mount.</span> On the pages of <span class="italic">Ancient Temple Worship</span> and <span class="italic">Temple Insights</span> are found new perspectives about ancient texts and objects that were used in temple worship. No doubt these new insights will give patrons something to contemplate as they seek inspiration in modern temples.</p>

			<p class="notice-title"><span class="italic">The Prophet and the Reformer: The Letters of Brigham Young and Thomas&#160;L. Kane,</span> edited by Matthew J. Grow and Ronald W. Walker (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015)</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-no-indent">Matthew J. Grow is the director of publications for the LDS Church History Department and is the author of <span class="italic">Liberty to the Downtrodden, </span>which is a biography of Thomas L. Kane. Ronald W. Walker, formerly a professor of history at Brigham Young University, is a prolific writer and Latter-day Saint historian. These two join their considerable talents and expertise to bring readers<span class="italic"> The Prophet and the Reformer: The Letters of Brigham Young and Thomas L. Kane</span>.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">Brigham Young was of course essential to the development of the Mormon community in Utah during the mid to late 1800s, both as a political and religious leader. In 1846, Brigham Young met Thomas L. Kane, an idealistic Philadelphia reformer, and he often relied on Kane for advice, political or otherwise, resulting in a rich correspondence over many years. Kane was a friend to and a public supporter of the early Saints and became known as the most important non-Mormon in the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">The unique camaraderie between Young and Kane led to many letters that are filled with valuable historical information and that give glimpses into their personal views, which are not widely known. Preceding every letter in <span class="italic">The Prophet and the Reformer</span> is a commentary by Matthew J. Grow and Ronald W. Walker, who elaborate on the historical context and provide readers with insights into the lives of Young and Kane. Readers will enjoy learning more about the lives of these two great men in Mormon history, as well as the various political upheavals and cultural tensions during this time period—such as the Mormon westward movement, Indian relations, and the Utah War.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">Brigham Young and Thomas L. Kane wrote at least one letter every year except for the years 1862, 1863, and 1865. The highest volume of letters was written during 1857 and 1858, the years of the Utah War. This high volume provides detailed accounts of the perplexing struggles that President Young and the Saints faced during that time, as well as the trust Young placed in Kane to act as a mediator between the Church and the federal government.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent"><span class="italic">The Prophet and the Reformer</span> is a valuable compilation of correspondence coming out of the nineteenth-century West. This book provides a unique understanding of the lives, characteristics, and friendship of two prominent men, as well as the life and times in which they lived. The world of Latter-day Saint documentary history is enhanced by this work, as <span class="italic">The Prophet and the Reformer</span> is the first publication to bring all the extant Young and Kane correspondence together in one place. </p>
