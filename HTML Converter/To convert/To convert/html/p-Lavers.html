			<p class="•poetry-title">The Happiest Day of Your Life</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent ParaOverride-1">You wake up and hear rain. You wake up<br />and think there’s not enough rain, not enough <br />songs about rain or memories of rain.<br />Of being numbed or warmed by rain. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent ParaOverride-1">You wake up. Your eyes are open.<br />Lilies in a moss-green bowl. Elms through <br />the window moving their hands like cellists. <br />Books exist. And paintings. And pillows.</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent ParaOverride-1">Blue Mountain and Saddle Mountain. <br />Abundance Creek. Alpha Centauri. Delft.<br />The woman in your dream was putting down<br />a crate of oranges, but then you woke up</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent ParaOverride-1">remembering there is custard. There is <br />Verdi, there is smoke-filled late-fall air. <br />And even joy in what it feels like to grieve. <br />Wanting to sleep instead of bear what </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent ParaOverride-1">you must. Like finishing the best book <br />in the world: “.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;And so they buried Hector, <br />tamer of horses.” You wake up, wanting to try. <br />You try. Here in the swirling eddies,</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent ParaOverride-1">in the dark river of time and decay. <br />There is rain. There is this day. There is <br />this day and no other. Praise it with trumpets <br />and zithers. Praise it however you can.</p>
