			<p class="Normal-no-indent ParaOverride-1">We lift our eyes from grazing. We<br />people should not be in the alfalfa,<br />which might bloat and kill us.<br />We people have four stomachs—one<br />to fill with fodder, one that turns,<br />one wherein our bravery reposes,<br />one to hold our souls. We people<br />bawl for others to join us. We believe<br />in our right to follow, even though<br />we are eating alfalfa, tasty but dangerous,<br />in this field on a high plateau above a killing<br />drop. We have herded ourselves, stumbled<br />up the path. We didn’t need to climb,<br />but no one turned off in a different direction.<br />Up here we can moo at the moon, we can<br />jump and kick, we can set our sights<br />on the great leap over. There is no freedom<br />like ours. Freedom for so many,<br />more and more ascending.<br />Now we rail about crowding, blame<br />the weak for being underfoot, whimper<br />that we are not getting enough<br />practice. The moon is a high target.<br />We have become a mass, a mess,<br />packed tighter and tighter, pushing<br />ourselves toward the edge, where at last<br />we will again be one and one and one,<br />individuals all along, a thin wisp of cirrus<br />between each self and its purposes.</p>
