			<p class="•brief-notice-title"><span class="italic">Lot Smith: Mormon Pioneer and American Frontiersman</span>, by Carmen R. Smith and Talana S. Hooper<span class="italic"> </span>(Salt Lake City: Greg Kofford Books, 2018)</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-no-indent">This extensive biography of prominent pioneer and Latter-day Saint Lot Smith was written by mother-daughter team Carmen R. Smith and Talana S. Hooper. Both have had previous interest and experience in writing history: Carmen Smith was awarded the <span class="italic">Utah Historical Quarterly </span>Editor’s Choice for her 1978 report on the rediscovery of the Mormon Battalion’s Lost Well, and Talana Hooper has published several family histories and compiled and edited a history of the people of Central, Arizona<span class="italic">.</span></p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">Their involvement in this biography began with Jim Smith, Lot Smith’s fifty-second son, who was born six months after his father’s death and naturally had a deep interest in his father’s life. This interest carried on to Jim’s son Omer Smith, who continued the research and shared it with his wife and daughter, Carmen Smith and Talana Hooper. After Omer’s death, Carmen and Talana carried on his work and compiled it into this biography. The personal, multi&#173;generational investment of the authors and their years of sacrifice to pursue this research enrich the biography and the readers’ experience with it.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">The contents of the biography cover Lot Smith’s time as a member of the Mormon Battalion; a minuteman in the Utah War; the color bearer general for the Nauvoo Legion; captain of the Life Guards who helped rescue the Willie and Martin handcart companies; a Civil War captain; a missionary to the British Isles; the first sheriff in Davis County, Utah; one of the first settlers of Arizona; and the most feared gunman in Arizona.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">Though Carmen Smith and Talana Hooper have personal connections to Lot Smith, they do not shy away from controversial topics such as polygamy, violence, and early settlers’ relationships with Native Americans. All of these topics together make for an interesting and informative read. This book will appeal to readers interested in Church history, the Civil War, the history and settlement of Utah and Arizona, polygamist life in the nineteenth century, Native American history, and life on the frontier.</p>

			<p class="•brief-notice-title"><span class="italic">The Earth Will Appear as the Garden of Eden,</span> edited by Jedediah S. Rogers and Matthew C. Godfrey (Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 2019)</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-no-indent"><span class="italic">The Earth Will Appear as the Garden of Eden</span> is a collection of essays designed to introduce, review, illustrate, and promote research and scholarship on the environmental history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The book well accomplishes these purposes in an honest and engaging fashion. While essays in edited volumes such as this are often uneven in terms of the quality and the contribution they offer, each piece in this work is remarkably well written and significant. As the book’s introduction explains, Latter-day Saint environmental history is a relatively new discipline, ripe with opportunities and avenues for engagement. The introduction and Jedediah S. &#173;Rogers’s opening essay constitute a wonderful primer for anyone embarking on Latter-day Saint environmental history research—I found myself wishing I had had these articles when I first began to dabble in the discipline. </p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">The remainder of the volume is divided into three parts. Part&#160;1 contains two essays, one by Sara Dant and the other by Thomas Alexander, a pioneer in this genre of history. These essays chronicle the history of environmental ethos, teachings, and practices that have prevailed among Church members and leaders over time and invite readers to assess their own understanding of the&#160;topic.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">Part 2 contains four essays that focus on the Church’s theology and its interaction with culture, geography, and the environment. In this section, Matthew C. Godfrey explores the Church’s concept of Zion and how its placement and establishment have impacted the environment. Brett D. Dowdle reviews the social, cultural, and environmental challenges faced both by early missionaries to Britain and by British converts in Nauvoo. Richard Francaviglia next offers a fascinating discussion of what maps produced by early Church members reveal about Church environmental history and perceptions. Betsy Gaines Quammen concludes part&#160;2 with an exploration of the historical, theological, cultural, economic, and environmental issues surrounding the establishment of Zion National Park.</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">Part 3 is a delightful anthology of articles covering a broad range of Church environmental history and issues. Jeff Nichols discusses the environmental and theological history of the livestock industry in Utah. Brian Frehner reviews the environmental history of irrigation in Utah and the challenges that controlling water created for the early Saints. Brian Q. Cannon follows with insights into the reasoning behind and environmental issues created by the Church’s early efforts to establish new agricultural settlements throughout the Intermountain West and how those efforts fostered federal land use regulation. Nathan N. Waite next provides an overview of the historical theology and culture of gardening among Church members and the environmental issues that have contributed to it. Rebecca K. Andersen concludes part&#160;3 with a serious look at the environmental impact of aggregate mining in Utah and its interaction with the Church and its historical sites. </p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">The volume concludes with two essays. The first is an epilogue by another pioneer in the discipline, George B. Handley, that provides a summary of what he has observed over the years regarding the Church’s, and Church members’, stances on, attitudes about, and actions toward caring for Creation. His essay gives hope for a future of responsible environmental stewardship. The closing essay by Elder Marcus B. Nash poignantly illustrates that hope and direction as he invites members of the Church to be environmentally careful and wise as we use and live on this earth God created for us. </p>

			<p class="•brief-notice-title"><span class="italic">Life beyond the Grave: Christian Interfaith Perspectives,</span> edited by Alonzo&#160;L. Gaskill and Robert L. Millet (Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 2019)</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-no-indent">As suggested in the title, <span class="italic">Life beyond the Grave</span> is a compilation of perspectives about the afterlife from a range of Christian denominations. The book’s contents were taken from a 2016 academic conference hosted at Brigham Young University. Titled “Beyond the Grave: Christian Interfaith Perspectives,” the ecumenical conference was designed to build understanding among Christian groups. Editor Robert L. Millet noted on the conference, “There has been no effort whatsoever to ignore theological differences between the various traditions, nor was it ever expected that a presenter compromise in the slightest what he or she holds to be true. .&#160;.&#160;. We came together to listen, to learn, to ask questions and inquire, in short, to better understand one another” (viii). </p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent"><span class="italic">Life beyond the Grave</span> reports on the presentations of ten scholars, each from a specific faith, including those who are Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Methodist, Calvinist, Latter-day Saint, Jehovah’s Witness, Seventh-day Adventist, and Episcopalian. Some presentations are general introductions to a faith’s basic beliefs: for example, in “Heaven Opened in the Soul: The Religious Imagination of Methodists,” David McAllister-Wilson explains the Methodist open-ended or “ad hoc” belief of the afterlife. “Methodists seem to believe in the afterlife in the way we believe there will be life found elsewhere in the universe some day and a cure for cancer will be found: we expect so; we hope so. And our hopes are loosely derived from our belief in a wondrous creation and a loving God” (54). </p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">Other pieces narrate theories or specific concepts regarding afterlife. Metropolitan Nikitas, for example, in “Changed by Grace: Some Introductory Thoughts on the Eastern Orthodox Understanding of Death and the Afterlife,” looks at some Eastern Orthodox traditions regarding burial of the dead: “The body is not to be cremated or given to science for research. These actions are understood by many to be a type of irreverence shown for God’s creation. .&#160;.&#160;. In fact, in traditional Orthodox lands there is no embalming, so the body may return to the earth as soon as possible” (22).</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">Two of the ten chapters present Latter-&#173;day Saint perspectives: Brent&#160;L. Top’s “The Near-Death Experience: Why Latter-day Saints Are So Interested” compares recorded near-death experiences of Latter-day Saints with the Church’s doctrine, explaining that “core elements [of near-death experiences] feel familiar to most Latter-day Saints because of unique teachings regarding the immortal human soul, the nature and capacities of the spirit body, and the purposes and conditions of the postearth spirit realm” (96). </p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent">In “Christ’s Descent into Hell: A Latter-day Saint Perspective,” Robert L. Millet addresses the enduring Christian “soteriological problem of evil” (113) with an explanation of the Latter-day Saint doctrine of the redemption for the dead; he extensively quotes Joseph Smith and the teachings of the Restoration, concluding that “Latter-day Saints’ hope in Christ is in the infinite capacity of an infinite Being to save men and women from ignorance as well as from sin and death. .&#160;.&#160;. His influence and redemptive mercies span the veil of death” (131–32).</p>
			<p class="•brief-notices-indent"><span class="italic">Life beyond the Grave</span> will appeal to readers interested in comparative religion, eschatology, and cultural awareness.</p>
