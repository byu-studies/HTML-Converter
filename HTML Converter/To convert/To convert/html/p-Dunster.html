			<p class="•poetry-title">Green Things</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Faith, they say, is a seed that grows. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">It swells, and as a mother I can say</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">that things inside swelling are not always </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">pleasant. But what sort of growing is always pleasant?</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">It swells. And as a mother, let me say—</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">growing things can pierce inside, an ache most</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">pleasant, but what sort of growing is always pleasant? </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Blood happens, and ribs crack as time passes. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Growing things can pierce inside, an ache most</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">trying. Young things can die and be cut off</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">as blood happens. And ribs may crack as time passes</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">and thorns pierce through. A young plant is fragile. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Even in trying, young things can die and be cut off</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">when waves of pain move through you, as your insides hurt</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">with thorns piercing through. A young plant is fragile</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">and if you hold back the water, it will soon die back. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">When waves of pain pass through you, when your insides hurt</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">because you have been stretched too far to keep</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">giving forth your waters, the bud will soon die back. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">It will soon seem to die, but anything green lives still. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Because you have been stretched too far to keep</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">a bud alive over winters of creeping doubt</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">it will soon seem to die. But anything green lives still</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">and if you see green in the stem you cut, it lives. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">A plant that lives over winters of creeping doubt</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">is a things that can still grow. <span class="italic">Cut it. Cut it. </span></p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">If you see green in the stem you cut, it lives. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent"><span class="italic">If you see that green inside, the Word still lives. </span></p>
