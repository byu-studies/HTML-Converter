			<p class="Normal-no-indent"><span class="italics">Todo lo que haces con tus manos tiene valor</span> she said, and we knew</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">what she meant. That Christmas card of glitter glue </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">and crayon. That yarn potholder born from a tiny loom</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">like a lute. Even the Pinewood Derby car, blue </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">with a white stripe down the middle, wobbling</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">its way into seventeenth place. We knew the making of it</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">was the point, what gave it worth. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">And we thought we knew all the things her hands </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">had made—tortillas, enchiladas, empanadas for Easter, </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">tamales for Christmas Eve, a Thanksgiving turkey </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">roasted in mole, and three dozen buñuelos to share </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">with my fifth-grade class. For my mom and tía Isa </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">she sewed dresses to match their Christmas dolls, and Isa,</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">knowing what they were worth, played only with my mom’s,</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">cutting its hair and dragging it through the dirt</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">until it was ragged, while the colors on hers remained bright. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Though that one is gone now. Gone, too, the bedspread she quilted </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">for me when I was small, a yellow ducky in a forest green border</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">that faded to sickly olive as I clutched it to myself for a decade,</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">feeling each even stitch for comfort until it disintegrated </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">in a slow blizzard of batting and fabric. I shiver to remember. </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">As for the rest—the aprons and folklórico dresses and baby </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">blankets with crocheted edges—it’s only a matter of time.</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">Only a matter of time for us. Already we have passed</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">the anniversary of the day when the last great-grandchild</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">who remembers being cradled in her trembling hands will pass</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">away. And then the day after, when we rise up, unabashed,</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">quickened by the knowledge that she meant us, </p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">that cradling too is creation, that we were the first</p>
			<p class="Normal-no-indent">and final work of her dark, refining hands.</p>
