It’s that she knows<br />the power of slow growth, of listening.<br />Now, as she turns her mind toward the world,<br />she’ll teach it what she’s learned, a better strength:<br />the strength of sea that, rising, can’t be caught<br />or kept restrained; the strength of milk and sun<br />and ink; the strength of those she’s raised to speak<br />the truth—the children who will match her stride<br />into the world and build it better. Now<br />her voice will not be hushed; this wind is fierce.<br />It winnows, working mysteries in the world.<br />There’s power in a truthful woman’s voice.</p>
