<h1>Heron Song</h1>
<p>Mornings, the heron descends to shore.</p>
<p>His silver wings crescendo the air,</p>
<p>fermata—then fold, seeking the sleek </p>
<p>curve of his body. He comes to stand </p>
<p>by the shore and wet his feet. To watch </p>
<p>the waves. Once, he snaps an eel</p>
<p>with his beak, its shoestring body </p>
<p>twisting like a pendulum.</p>
<p>He grips it like a surgeon, sure </p>
<p>and still, patient, waiting while </p>
<p>it undulates, waiting while </p>
<p>it loosens, finally going limp. </p>
<p>Then—he flicks his head, snaps </p>
<p>his jaws to slide it down in one, </p>
<p>two, three slow beats.</p>
<p>But mostly, he stands, gazing out</p>
<p>over the bay. He is still, </p>
<p>contemplative. I wonder what </p>
<p>reflections swirl in his walnut brain:</p>
<p>watching the clouds for certain wings. </p>
<p>Wondering why the water turns </p>
<p>from calm chartreuse to cinnamon. </p>
<p>Marks that water, the collective, </p>
<p>isn’t quite the word for </p>
<p>a million facets of light and shadow.</p>
<p>Or, listening to the rhythm </p>
<p>of the waves, if he’s counting </p>
<p>out the measure of his creation.</p>
