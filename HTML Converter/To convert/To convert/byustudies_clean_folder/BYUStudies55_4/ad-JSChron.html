<p>Joseph Smith’s remarkable life is here recorded as a sequence that can be searched by date (year or month) or by category tags (personal life, visions and revelations, writings, ecclesiastical duties, legal events, ­travels, and political events). The chronology lists events that can be tied to specific days or months. Each entry contains a brief summary along with references for further information.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Joseph’s experiences were expansive, and this chronology is evidence of the energetic pace and broad scope of concerns that characterized Joseph’s daily activities. We hope that this chronology will be a useful resource that will place events in context of his circumstances and reveal connections and patterns.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The chronology is now updated to reflect new information published by the Joseph Smith Papers project.</p>
