<p>As you read the accounts of divine manifestations in <em>Opening the <br/></em><em> </em><em>Heavens,</em> the truth of the Restoration events becomes clearer. The original eyewitness accounts will endure for generations, making this one of the most persuasive and influential Church history books you may ever read or own.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Joseph Smith had only one request of the publisher of the <em>Chicago Democrat,</em> to whom he directed his now-famous Wentworth Letter: “All that I shall ask at his hands, is, that he publish the account entire, ungarnished, and without misrepresentation.” Since 1959, BYU Studies has been a premier publisher of primary historical docu­ments in LDS Church history. Continuing this tradition, <em>Opening the ­Heavens</em> gathers in one place the key historical collections documenting divine manifestations from 1820 to 1844. Gathered here are the historical documents concerning the First Vision, the translation of the Book of Mormon, the restoration of the priesthood, the many visions of Joseph Smith, the outpouring of keys at the Kirtland Temple, and the mantle of Joseph Smith passing to Brigham Young.</p>
