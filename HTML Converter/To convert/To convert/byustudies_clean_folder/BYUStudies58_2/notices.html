<h1><em>Utah and the American Civil War: The Written Record,</em> edited by Kenneth L. Alford<em> </em>(Norman: Arthur H. Clark Company, an imprint of University of Oklahoma Press, 2017)</h1>
<p>There are two schools of thought about Utah’s participation in the Civil War: it was de minimis, unworthy of comparison to the blood-soaked contributions of nearly all other American states and territories; or, it was larger than the size of its troop commitment to the Union Army and has a record more complex than is often understood. With this book, <em>Utah and the American Civil War,</em> Kenneth L. Alford is squarely in the latter camp, arguing that “the common belief that Utah Territory ‘sat out’ the Civil War is incorrect. Although the territory was removed from the war’s devastation and provided only one active-duty military unit . . . , the war deeply affected Utah and its inhabitants—from pioneers and Union soldiers stationed in Utah to the Native Americans they clashed with throughout the war” (15). What follows to support this assertion is a mammoth, 864-page collection of military documents, ancillary material, and analysis. Alford is a native of Ogden, Utah; BYU professor of Church history and doctrine; retired army colonel; former West Point teacher; expert in large-scale data organization; and published authority on Utah’s involvement in the Civil War. As such, he was extraordinarily well equipped to assemble and lead the team of undergraduate and graduate students who grappled with a tsunami of documents to produce this user-friendly reference book. </p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Most of the official documents presented here have previously been published by the War Department during the decades straddling the turn of the twentieth century. The documents, however, were embedded in 128 volumes of military orders, telegrams, and letters bearing a title as cumbersome as their accessibility: <em>The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies.</em> What Alford has done for readers interested primarily in the war’s role in the West and Utah may be summarized with three words: organization, focus, and context.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">In a useful introduction and three opening chapters, the editor summarizes the history of Utah and the Civil War while describing what the <em>Official Records (OR) </em>are and how they were produced about 120 years ago. In another five hundred pages, chapter 4 presents the heart of the study—the <em>OR </em>documents relating primarily to Utah. Chapter 5, one of the more unique parts of the book, devotes two hundred pages to additional records related to wartime Utah that were inexplicably excluded from the <em>OR.</em> Through eight short appendices, Alford then provides aids that give additional context to the subject at hand. These aids include information on military terminology, geography, and the territory’s changing political boundaries. Enhancing the accessibility of all this information is Galen Schroeder’s excellent thirty-six-page index, a seemingly mundane section but one that is crucial for a documentary history of this scope and complexity.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">In reviewing a different documentary history (a recently published volume of the<em> Joseph Smith Papers</em>), a historian described that rather dense study as “the researcher’s paradise and a casual reader’s nightmare.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-000" id="footnote-000-backlink">1</a></sup> I do not view <em>Utah and the American Civil War </em>this way. Because of its clarity and orderliness, Alford’s study is unquestionably valuable to professional historians needing the details of what happened in Utah Territory during 1861–65, but the book also has merit for serious nonacademic readers. A wide range of students will find in these documents a useful, objective account of Utah’s role in the Civil War. Alford’s sense of balance is a good one to have alongside other recent narrative accounts by other historians who view Brigham Young’s leadership during both the Utah War and the national fratricide that soon followed in terms of conspiracy theories and unpatriotic motives.</p>

<h1><em><a id="_idTextAnchor001"></a>The Expanded Canon: Perspectives on Mormonism and Sacred Texts,</em> edited by Blair G. Van Dyke, Brian D. Birch, and Boyd J. Petersen (Salt Lake City: Greg Kofford Books, 2018)</h1>
<p>If you are looking for excellent scholarship and insights into Latter-day Saint scripture, you might want to start with this new compilation from Greg Kofford Books. The authors of the fourteen essays in this volume explore a wide range of topics related to the Latter-day Saint canon and offer a surprisingly consistent level of discourse. Usually anthologies include a few weak links, but that is not the case with this volume.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The opening essay, “The Triangle and the Sovereign: Logics, Histories, and an Open Canon,” by David Frank Holland, is by itself worth the price of the book. Holland examines the sometimes uneasy interplay among the three sources of revelatory authority in the Church: canonized scripture, prophetic teachings, and personal revelation. His discussion of the limitations placed on the assumed sovereignty of prophetic declaration by the other two sides of the authority triangle should be carefully considered by every Latter-day Saint.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">I don’t have space to give even a cursory summary of the other essays, but a brief sentence about each of the authors and their topics should be sufficient to give a flavor of the book and its quality.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Brian D. Birch discusses “authori­tative discourse in comparative perspective” (27), including the transformation of revelation in the Church from charismatic to bureaucratic and the notion of “practical infallibility.” James E. Faulconer argues for a literal interpretation of scripture but employs a very carefully explicated definition of <em>literal.</em> Claudia L. Bushman proposes a body of extra­canonical scripture for and by Latter-­day Saint women and offers a thoughtful list of suggested inclusions. Grant Hardy examines the Book of Mormon “in the context of world scripture,” looking for similarities and differences (73). In the shortest essay in the volume, Richard Lyman Bushman comments on “the way we approach the Book of Mormon as modern, educated Latter-day Saints, particularly as our reading is affected by the gold plates” (85).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">In one of two essays written by non–Latter-day Saint scholars, Ann Taves struggles with the task of taking Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon seriously while trying to explain why he did not really have material plates to translate from. David Bokovoy next examines the book of Moses as a form of prophetic midrash, followed by Brian M. Hauglid, who recounts the Pearl of Great Price’s path toward both canonization and legitimation. One of the most informative essays in the book is by Paul C. Gutjahr, the other non–Latter-day Saint author, who discusses four pivotal moments in the publication history of the Book of Mormon and illustrates how “sacred scriptures are by necessity mediated hybrids, meshing purported supernatural interventions with more mundane human efforts” (157).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Grant Underwood celebrates rather than critiques the revisions to Joseph Smith’s revelations, giving both statistics and examples of the editorial changes that Joseph and others made to the texts he dictated. In a fascinating account, Blair G. Van Dyke recounts the long process of “spiritualizing” digital scripture in the Church. Boyd J. Petersen and David W. Scott examine the quasi­canonical document “The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” assessing how authoritative it is among various types of Latter-day Saints. Finally, Gordon Shepherd and Gary Shepherd discuss a particular noncanonical form of revelation in the Church—patriarchal blessings—and their development in the early years of the Restoration.</p>

<h1><em><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Moramona: The Mormons in Hawai‘i</em> by R. Lanier Britsch, 2d ed. (Laie, Hawai‘i: Brigham Young University–Hawai‘i, 2018)</h1>
<p><em>Moramona</em> is the quintessential history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Hawai‘i. The book journeys from the first missionaries arriving on the islands in 1850 and their initial struggles to maintain a foothold there to the eventual success of the Church <br/><br/>on the islands. The book concludes with a summary of the current prosperity of the Church in Hawai‘i, including the successes of Brigham Young University–Hawai‘i, the Kona Hawai‘i Temple, and the rich culture of faith among today’s members.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The first edition of <em>Moramona</em> was written in 1975 and published in 1989. This second edition enriches the original content with colored photos, personal stories of significant figures, and refined presentation. The second edition also adds over forty years of relevant history after 1975. Other additions include a foreword by Reid L. Neilson, an assistant Church historian; an explanatory preface by author R. Lanier Britsch; and a prologue on pre-1820 Hawaiian history.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The contents of the volume were “painstakingly gathered, refined, and shared” (xviii) by Britsch, the Church’s foremost expert on Church history in Asia and Oceania. Britsch received a PhD in Asian studies from Claremont Graduate University in 1967, and he taught history and Asian studies at Brigham Young University–Provo and served as the vice-president of academics at Brigham Young University–Hawai‘i.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0"><em>Moramona</em> is recommendable to those interested in the Church and its history in the Hawaiian islands. The book accommodates casual reading with its easy-to-read language, elegant organization, and narrated personal histories, but also facilitates detailed study with its glossary, a Hawaiian pronunciation guide, and statistical reports.</p>
