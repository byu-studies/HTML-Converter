<h1>Winter Rail Yard</h1>
<p>I hear the coal train’s organ note in the distance,</p>
<p>remember the two pigeons</p>
<p>circling together and pecking the open ground</p>
<p>between ties near the tracks.</p>
<p>They were smoke-purple birds, white-winged.</p>
<p>And even if a train by some surprise could pass over them</p>
<p>violently vibrating their walls on either side,</p>
<p>they would be safe in the center from every moving part,</p>
<p>not just the unearthly noise of torqueing iron axle.</p>
<p>These birds probably have learned by now</p>
<p>that after its spray-painted flanks clunk and clunk and rail away,</p>
<p>it’s all just the sound of commuters’ engines again</p>
<p>and a slightly stronger morning sun.</p>
<p>—Matthew Scott Stenson</p>
