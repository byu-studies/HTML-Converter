<p>The Epistle to the Hebrews is a faith-filled testimony of Jesus Christ. This commentary is the most comprehensive study of the epistle that Latter-day Saint scholars have yet produced. The volume is not written for an academic audience but for anyone interested in a detailed examination of this highly spiritual and insightful work.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The commentary presents the full Greek text alongside the King James Version and the authors’ New Rendition, followed by translation notes and analysis. The translation notes explain the meaning and context of words, phrases, and passages and the choice of words in the New Rendition. The analysis examines the doctrine and teachings of each section, opening the epistle to the reader’s understanding.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The work strives to be up to date, comprehensive, scholarly, and as doctrinally sound as possible. It relies on the canon of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Joseph Smith Translation, and teachings of latter-day prophets alongside rigorous biblical scholarship and the original Greek text.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">This commentary has the same purpose as the epistle itself: to bear witness of the Lord and his lifegiving ministry.</p>
