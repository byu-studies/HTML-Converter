<h1>My Son’s Guitar Class</h1>
<p>is tucked above a carpet store</p>
<p>on a busy street with no parking</p>
<p>so that I come in panting </p>
<p>with the smell of traffic in my clothes, </p>
<p>tight-necked from the argument in the car </p>
<p>because this boy won’t be hurried. </p>
<p>But, settled on a bench in the back, I </p>
<p>watch him bend to his patterning. Soon</p>
<p>the walls disappear into feathered strummings </p>
<p>that eddy around my ankles, pile gauzy in corners </p>
<p>like cottonwood. I wish I could tuck</p>
<p>a gentle tendril against my wrist </p>
<p>to pull from my sleeve and wave, a white flag,</p>
<p>whenever I feel my jaw clench </p>
<p>at this boy. He arches his neck</p>
<p>over the trailing crochet of music,</p>
<p>gazing off at something</p>
<p>beyond us both.</p>
<p>—Darlene Young</p>
