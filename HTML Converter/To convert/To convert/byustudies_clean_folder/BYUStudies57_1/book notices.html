<h1>Patrick Q. Mason, ed., <em>Directions for Mormon Studies in the Twenty-First Century </em>(Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 2016)</h1>
<p>At its heart,<em> Directions for Mormon Studies in the Twenty-First Century </em>is a cele­bra­tion of religious studies in general and of Mormon studies in particular. The book presents twelve provocative essays written by scholars from multiple disciplines and various parts of the world. The essays are divided into five parts, each part focusing on either a topic or a methodology.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Though the book does present some new research, its value lies in the authors’ insights, which form a cohesive argument in favor of propagating and deepening Mormon studies. Each of the essays introduces a problem that exists either in Mormon studies or in the Mormon world, argues that further research is needed to solve the problem, and presents a small example of what that research can look like. </p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Part 1 shows how scholars can use political and sociological theory—particularly progressivism and studies of ethnicity—to better understand the Church and its members. Part 2 delves into Africa and Japan, suggests a deeper study of world cultures as they relate to Mormonism, and calls for a reevaluation of what many Mormons consider “gospel culture.” Part 3 encourages scholars to move beyond the study of race relations between white Mormons and their nonwhite neighbors and to consider nonwhite perspectives and experiences within Mormonism. Part 5 similarly urges scholars to examine nontraditional Mormon memoirs to get a fuller picture of the Mormon experience and considers the role and significance of record keeping in the Church.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">While the other parts of the book encourage certain methodologies merely by extension, part 4 focuses explicitly on methodology. The essays in this part—written by an economist, two sociologists, and a historian, respectively—demonstrate the extent to which Mormon studies could benefit from expanding beyond the discipline of history.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Reading <em>Directions</em> will help new Mormon studies scholars who want to better grasp the field as they prepare to contribute to it. The book will also be helpful to LDS individuals who are not scholars but who would like an introduction to Mormon scholarship and issues facing the Mormon world.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The editor of <em>Directions,</em> Patrick Q. Mason, is the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies and associate professor of religion at Claremont Graduate University<em>.</em></p>

<h1><a id="_idTextAnchor001"></a>Craig James Ostler, Michael Hubbard MacKay, and Barbara Morgan Gardner, eds., <em>Foundations of the Restoration: Fulfillment of the Covenant Purposes</em> (Provo, Utah: BYU Religious Studies Center; Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2016)</h1>
<p>This volume is a collection of fifteen papers presented at the forty-fifth annual Sidney B. Sperry Symposium, held in October 2016. The title and subject matter of the symposium were drawn from the LDS Institute course titled “Foundations of the Restoration,” which explores the events surrounding the founding of the Church and early Mormonism. The editors, Craig James Ostler, Michael Hubbard MacKay, and Barbara Morgan Gardner, are all members of BYU’s Church History and Doctrine Department.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The volume covers a variety of topics, including the Sabbath day, eternal marriage, conceptions of Zion, consecration, Hyrum Smith’s Liberty Jail letters, William W. Phelps’s contributions to understanding Church history, the First Vision, the Articles of Faith, Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible, the evaluation of doctrine, the development of LDS temples and temple ordinances, and the sustaining of Church leaders as seers, revelators, and prophets.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">A helpful contribution found in the volume is an essay by Alexander L. Baugh, an expert on the Mormon experience in Missouri, that explores the Adam-ondi-Ahman revelation, found in Doctrine and Covenants 116 (157–88). World religion professor Andrew C. Reed examines early Mormon interests in Judaism in another essay (225–44), and Anthony R. Sweat, Michael Hubbard MacKay, and Gerrit J. Dirkmaat—assistant professors of Church history and doctrine at BYU—provide a helpful model for evaluating and classifying LDS doctrine (23–44). The symposium’s keynote address, by LDS scholar Robert L. Millet, is the first selection featured in the volume and is a clear, beautiful, and inspiring discussion of Joseph Smith’s role in the Restoration of the gospel (1–22). </p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Created with Church curriculum in mind, this volume is directly for “teachers and students as they study and teach key events and doctrines of the Restoration” (vii). However, any who wish to deepen their study and understanding of the Restoration will find this collection valuable. </p>

<h1><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>J. Spencer Fluhman and Brent L. Top, eds., <em>Let Us Reason Together: Essays in Honor of the Life’s Work of Robert L. Millet</em> (Provo, Utah: BYU Religious Studies Center, 2016)</h1>
<p><em>Let Us Reason Together </em>is a Festschrift honoring the work of Robert L. Millet, a renowned scholar and former dean of Religious Education at Brigham Young University. The volume covers a variety of disciplines and subjects, representative of the breadth of Millet’s corpus, which comprises over sixty publications on a variety of topics. <em>Let Us Reason Together </em>is likewise broad in its coverage, though its title and articles particularly highlight one of Millet’s most notable accomplishments: his work reaching out to members of Christian traditions outside his own LDS faith. This is noticeable in the fact that some of the articles in the book were written by adherents of other faiths, including Cory B. Willson and Richard J. Mauw. Millet’s interfaith work is also highlighted by the strong thread of comparative Christianity found throughout the articles.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The book is divided into three sections, each emphasizing a main theme in Millet’s writings: doctrine, scriptures, and Christianity. The essays in the section on doctrine delve into deep doctrine for a brief moment but never stray too far from discussions of core LDS beliefs. The section on scriptures analyzes a range of topics, from a single scriptural word to a collection of scriptures. The last section comprises mostly essays on comparative Christianity.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Among its contents, <em>Let Us Reason Together </em>features an analysis from Shon D. Hopkin of grace in relation to the degrees of heavenly glory (329–56) as well as fine observations from Daniel K Judd on Martin Luther's history (311–28). Mauw’s essay diplomatically discusses differing theological views on the nature of God (231–38), and a deep consideration of the LDS concept of intelligences is offered by Camille Fronk Olson (4–9). An article by Dennis L. Okholm considers how to define Christianity, troubles the traditional models of defining a religion as Christian, and suggests a new way of determining whether or not a sect is part of Christianity (357–70). Other offerings in the book include an essay from Richard E. Bennett on the importance of historicity in religion (81–94) and an analysis from John W. Welch of one of Jesus’s lesser-studied parables (97–116). The volume also features works from a number of other contributors, including Brian D. Birch, Craig L. Blomberg, Richard O. Cowan, Larry E. Dahl, Megan Hansen, J. B. Haws, Paul Y. Hoskisson, Kerry Muhlestein, Lloyd D. Newell, Dana M. Pike, Andrew C. Skinner, Stephen O. Smoot, and Brent L. Top.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0"><em>Let Us Reason Together </em>is particularly useful for Christians desiring to understand LDS beliefs and for Latter-day Saints who want to improve their ability to converse with other Christians. With its comparative analyses, interfaith explanations, kind critiques, diverse viewpoints, and questions, this collection of articles not only honors Millet’s legacy, but also contributes to discussions on a variety of religious, doctrinal, and interfaith topics. Its messages invite readers to join the conversation as fellow Christians, rather than as members of competing theological camps.</p>

<h1><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>William P. MacKinnon, ed., <em>At Sword’s Point, Part 1: A Documentary History of the Utah War to 1858,</em> and <em>Part 2: A Documentary History of the Utah War, 1858–1859,</em> vols. 10 and 11 of <em>Kingdom in the West: The Mormons and the American Frontier,</em> ed. Will Bagley and David L. Bigler (Norman, Okla.: The Arthur H. Clark Company, 2008, 2016)</h1>
<p>Using six decades of research, historian William MacKinnon has created a masterful two-volume documentary history of the Utah War. In creating this helpful collection, he did not reprint documents that were overly long or readily available from other sources. The two volumes tell “the story of the Utah War’s origins, prosecution, and impact” and highlight “a crucial crisis in the history of the Mormon people” (part 1, 12). </p>
<p class="indent-1-0">In part 1, MacKinnon describes “an escalating series of incidents” involving “virtually every aspect of federal-Mormon interface: the quality of mail service; the jurisdiction of county, territorial, and federal courts; the evenhandedness of criminal justice; [and] Indian relations” (part 1, 43). He identifies the territorial resolution of January 6, 1857, as a pivotal moment; the resolution declared, “We will not tamely submit to being abused by the Government Officials, here in this Territory; they shall not come here to corrupt our community, set at defiance our laws, trample upon the rights of the people, [and] stir up the Indians” (part 1, 71). Secretary of the Interior Jacob Thompson called the resolution “a declaration of war” (part 1, 102).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">In part 2, MacKinnon documents Kit Carson’s claims that Mormons tried to persuade Colorado Utes to join forces with them; the US Army’s exploration to see if the Colorado River could become a supply route; and Brigham Young’s proposal for a “Standing Army of Israel” (part 2, 67). MacKinnon discusses US senator Sam Houston’s support of the Mormons and Utah Territory Supreme Court chief justice Delana R. Eckels’s attempts to “poke the bee hive” by prosecuting polygamy (part 2, 385). The book offers ample evidence that the territorial governor Alfred Cumming was more articulate and politically adept than earlier historians have given him credit for. The illuminating analysis of the Utah War in the “Conclusions” section is alone worth the price of the volume.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Although some readers may quibble with the books’ interpretations, Mac­Kinnon has performed a remarkable feat in finding and reproducing these vital documents. These books will appeal to readers who are interested in learning about Mormon history, the Utah War, Manifest Destiny, and the colonization of the American West.</p>

<h1><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>Matthew J. Grow and R. Eric Smith, eds., <em>The Council of Fifty: What the Records Reveal about Mormon History</em> (Provo, Utah: BYU Religious Studies Center; Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2017)</h1>
<p>The announcement in September 2013 that the LDS Church would be publishing a transcript of the Council of Fifty minutes came as welcome news to the Mormon scholarly community. Previously considered confidential and kept in the First Presidency’s vault, the record had been unavailable for reading and research for 160 years. This secrecy had two consequences: debate and speculation among the scholarly community about the record’s contents, and complete ignorance of the council among most average Church members. But at long last, the transcript was published in 2016 as the sole volume in the Administrative Records series of the Joseph Smith Papers:<em> The Joseph Smith Papers, Administrative Records: Council of Fifty Minutes, March 1844–January 1846,</em> ed. Matthew J. Grow and others<em> </em>(Salt Lake City: The Church Historian’s Press).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">While the publication is a welcome and valuable addition to the corpus of publically available documents on Church history, it is likely difficult for most readers to comb through the eight-hundred-page tome (complete with over one thousand footnotes) and glean what is new and important in the record. The solution? A compilation of fifteen essays, written by historians for a broad audience, on the new insights found in the Council of Fifty minutes.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0"><em>The Council of Fifty: What the Records Reveal about Mormon History </em>begins with an introduction briefly outlining the history of the council and explaining the decision to publish the record and make it available to the public for the first time. The fifteen articles that follow cover a variety of topics that touch on the nature of the council and how it functioned, as well as its objectives and influence in the Mormon community. Some of the topics covered include Joseph Smith’s campaign for the US presidency, the concept of “theo­democracy,” religious liberty, significant statements made by Church leaders in council meetings, and what the minutes reveal about Brigham Young’s leadership style and personality. The volume also discusses the council’s constitution, record-keeping practices, mission to reach out to American Indians, efforts to complete the Nauvoo House, and role in preparing for the Saint’s westward migration.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Both of the editors for the volume currently work in the LDS Church History Department. Matthew J. Grow is the director of publications in the department and a general editor for the Joseph Smith Papers, and R. Eric Smith is the editorial manager for the Joseph Smith Papers Project<em>.</em> Both were heavily involved in the publication of the full transcript of the Council of Fifty minutes. Several of the other contributors to the volume are also historians with the Joseph Smith Papers Project, and others are scholars in Mormon studies from several different universities and organizations.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Clocking in at just two hundred pages, this book is an accessible introduction to a record and an organization that has long been shrouded in mystery and speculation. At the end of the introduction, the editors state they “hope that this collection of essays both increases public knowledge about the Council of Fifty and spurs further scholarship” (xv). Meant to be a starting point for future discussion, this compilation will be helpful to any reader or scholar interested in learning about the Council of Fifty or wishing to enhance their study of the complete council minutes.</p>

<h1><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>Jennifer Reeder and Kate Holbrook, eds.,<em> At the Pulpit: 185 Years of Discourses by Latter-day Saint Women</em> (Salt Lake City: Church Historian’s Press, 2017)</h1>
<p><em>At the Pulpit</em> joins other notable recent books on Latter-day Saint women such as <em>The First Fifty Years of Relief Society, The Witness of Women,</em> the books in the <em>Women of Faith</em> series, and the long-running series of books from the BYU Women’s Conference. Each of these seeks to bring the records of female Saints out of relative obscurity. Editors Jennifer Reeder and Kate Holbrook help move this effort forward in <em>At the Pulpit, </em>which presents fifty-four discourses of fifty-one women in full and takes the reader from 1830 up to the present. </p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Many of the discourses included here were previously hard to find, such as several early talks recorded in journals and minutes. The editors cast their net widely and included a song, a discussion group, and speeches outside of general Relief Society meetings and general conferences. The women featured include a few from places outside the United States, namely, Germany, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, and Kenya. Each of the discourses is introduced by a brief biography and description of the talk’s original setting.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">It is inspiring to not only read the women’s words but to also realize and recognize the contributions their words have made in the growth of the restored Church. The messages of these women teach readers to look to God, develop Christlike characteristics, and understand and appreciate the depth of the gospel. In one discourse, Drusilla Hendricks tells of her husband becoming paralyzed in the violent encounters in Missouri and of facing the decision of her son to join the Mormon Battalion (51–54). Francine R. Bennion delves deeply into the theology of suffering and individuals’ role in their relationship with God, leading to wholeness (212–31). And Julie Beck sees priesthood quorums and Relief Society groups as instrumental in creating a kingdom of God on earth (295–307).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The book also reminds Latter-day Saints that Church structure was not always like it is now. For example, in the 1970s and ’80s Elaine A. Cannon advocated for a magazine dedicated to the youth of the Church, for Sunday religious instruction for young sisters in addition to Sunday School, and for a general women’s meeting (204–11).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">An index helps users find discourses on topics, making it easy to use the book in talks and lessons. An appendix collects the names of all the women who have spoken in general conferences and leadership meetings associated with general conferences. The list begins with Lucy Mack Smith, who spoke at a general Church session in 1845; the next women to speak in a general session were Louise Y. Robison, Ruth May Fox, and Mary Anderson, who spoke over eighty years later in the October 1929 general conference. The book fills in this gap, featuring at least one discourse from every decade since 1830.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The Church Historian’s Press has published the entire volume free online at <a href="https://www.churchhistorianspress.org/at-the-pulpit">https://www.churchhistorianspress.org/at-the-pulpit</a>. The website also offers a handy chronology that places the discourses in the context of women’s events in Church history, such as the switch from the <em>Woman’s Exponent</em> to the <em>Relief Society Magazine</em> in 1915.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Giving helpful visibility to the project, in 2018 the Church is running in the <em>Ensign</em> and <em>Liahona</em> a series of excerpts from <em>At the Pulpit</em> and titled the series by that name, directly linking it to the book. The February magazines invite readers to “take a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the book upon which the magazine series is based” and gives a URL (3). The URL leads <br/><br/>to the digital-only article “Meeting the Women behind the Pulpit,” which is also listed in the online table of contents of the magazines. This short article tells the stories behind two of the featured speakers in <em>At the Pulpit,</em> and Reeder and Holbrook conclude, “We witnessed how God teaches us through the records that our fellow Latter-day Saints left behind. Coming to know the authors of these discourses enriched our own ability to meet life’s challenges as we work to do our part in building God’s kingdom.” May this mission be carried on to future publications featuring the voices of women as they preach and testify about the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the frigid circumstances, a genuine warmth emanates from the Alaskan Saints. The match that lit this internal flame was the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, first striking the Alaskan borders at the turn of the twentieth century. The Latter-day Saints have subtly shaped Alaskan society, although composing less than 5 percent of the state’s population. Their influence on Alaskan communities can be seen through their family values, humanitarian service, community projects, and family history centers. This book tells the story of the rise and influence of Latter-­day Saints as they joined hands on their journey of “melting the ice.”</p>
<p>“Alaska has one of the highest per capita populations of Latter-day Saints of any state in the nation, yet no scholarly history has been written about the LDS Church in the Last Frontier. Until now. Fred Woods’s <em>Melting the Ice</em> is an engrossing read about how many dedicated individ­uals have contributed to the social and spiritual development of Alaska.”</p>
