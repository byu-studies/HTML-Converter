<h1>Breeze</h1>
<p>What if our prayers were the wind to God,</p>
<p>and carried our thoughts like the smell of cut grass </p>
<p>and barbecued meat and skunk musk</p>
<p>and cow dung and tire-kicked dust?</p>
<p>Carried our thoughts to God,</p>
<p>standing in the sunlit fields of heaven—</p>
<p>our thoughts, collecting like cottonwood seeds </p>
<p>in the arches of his feet?</p>
<p>Cottonwood seeds, shifting and shivering like faith; </p>
<p>settling on his clothes;</p>
<p>clinging to the backs of his hands; </p>
<p>to his hair, in a wavering halo?</p>
<p>What if God went carefully about his hallowed work </p>
<p>there in the sifting, fitful air,</p>
<p>not wishing to dislodge a single thought </p>
<p>from its place with him?</p>
<p>—Daniel Teichert</p>
