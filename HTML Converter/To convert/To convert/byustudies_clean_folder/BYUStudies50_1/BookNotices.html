<p><em>By What Authority? The Vital Questions of Religious Authority in Christianity</em>, edited by Robert L. Millet (Macon, Ga.: Mercer University Press, 2010)</p>
<p>It appears that I have stumbled upon the answer to Juliet’s timeless question, “What’s in a name?” (<em>Romeo and Juliet,</em> act 2, scene 2). While a rose, by any other name, may have smelled as sweet to Juliet, the name of a book can make a significant difference for a reader.</p>
<p> <em>By What Authority?</em> is a compilation of papers delivered at a 2006 Brigham Young University conference on religious authority. The subtitle of the book (<em>The Vital Questions of Religious Authority in Christianity</em>) and the preface (authored by Robert L. Millet) imply that the text is an ecumenical examination of how various traditions—Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Seventh-day Adventist, and Latter-day Saint (to name a few)—perceive authority, priesthood, hierarchy, and the like. As evidence of what appears to be the book’s intended goal, one chapter’s author writes: “For nearly two millennia, meetings have convened to discuss authority in Christian traditions” (124). Another chapter indicates: “In one way or another, most of the theological issues that divide Christians today end up reflecting our different conceptions of authority” (36). Consequently, I was initially drawn to this text because I had hoped that through reading its pages I would come to a clearer understanding of how various Christian traditions answer “the vital questions of religious authority.” Certain chapters accomplished that goal—although others have as their purpose something different.</p>
<p>	The book’s strength lies in Millet’s ability to pull together the <em>who’s who</em> of a subject so that the reader can learn from the brightest and the best in the field. This volume is no disappointment in that regard. Gerald McDermott, Roger Olson, and the late Richard John Neuhaus are but a few of the significant theological minds of our era who contributed a paper to this volume.</p>
<p> <em>By What Authority?</em> also offers some important points of clarification on matters often misunderstood. For example, in Peter Huff’s article on “Authority in the Catholic Tradition,” the text points out that Catholic authority rests <em>not </em>in the two-dimensional model of scripture + tradition (as it is so often explained) but, rather, in a four-dimensional model combining tradition, scripture, episcopal authority, and the influence of the Holy Spirit. Likewise, in Bradley Nassif’s article “‘Authority’ in the Eastern Orthodox Tradition,” an important point of clarification is made regarding the sense in which Eastern Orthodox Christians believe in “apostolic succession”—namely through “communion ecclesiology” or the “succession of communities” rather than the succession of “apostles” or “bishops” (42–43, 44–45). These are important points of clarification, establishing why a book on this topic is important.</p>
<p>	However, readers expecting an ecumenical exploration of religious authority may be somewhat frustrated with parts of the book. Several chapters have almost nothing to do with what appears to be the intended subject: for example, Robert Randolph’s article on the Church of Christ (96–107), and David Neff’s paper on reading the Bible for application (162–79). While these articles were well written and interesting, they strayed from the subject of authority.</p>
<p>	Likewise, some of the articles break from the ecumenical spirit that prevails in much of this book. For example, Richard John Neuhaus’s article sought to explain the dichotomy between papal infallibility and the individual Christian’s need for autonomy. However, as a convert to Catholicism, Neuhaus seemed more interested in defending the Catholic position than he was in simply explaining it. Likewise, I felt that Stephen Ricks’s article did little to establish what the orthodox LDS position is on authority. Rather, the article felt more like a polemic designed to gently debunk the contemporary Roman Catholic doctrine of apostolic succession through bishops. </p>
<p>	While the inevitable typos and a somewhat inconsistent tone cause some chapters to feel very academic while others feel rather folksy, overall this book is well worth reading. For Latter-day Saint readers, one of the benefits they will gain from reading this book is an awareness that many people in other Christian traditions see some of the questions posed by Mormons on the subject of religious authority as nonissues.</p>

<p><em>Days Never to Be Forgotten: Oliver Cowdery, </em>edited by Alexander L. Baugh (BYU Religious Studies Center and Deseret Book, 2009)</p>
<p><em>Days Never to Be Forgotten</em> presents the fruits of the 2006 BYU Church History Symposium on the life and work of Oliver Cowdery in honor of the two hundredth anniversary of his birth. Eleven scholars of Mormon history contributed essays about various aspects of Cowdery’s life and involvement in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Ultimately, the contributors have two goals: to honor Cowdery’s memory and to inform believers who may not be aware of Cowdery’s importance in the founding of the Church.</p>
<p>	This book gives a good sense of Cowdery’s extensive presence and activities in the earliest days of the Church. His conversion, his roles in the restoration of the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods, and his participation in the transcription and publication of the Book of Mormon are covered in detail. Cowdery was also centrally involved in disseminating Church doctrine by editing the Book of Commandments, by writing the earliest known version of Joseph Smith’s initial visions, and by serving as editor of the <em>Messenger and Advocate</em>. Underscoring Cowdery’s significance, authors in this book declare: “No one was more involved in the key events of the restoration than Oliver Cowdery” (15), and “excluding Joseph Smith, no other person is mentioned more often in the Doctrine and Covenants than Oliver Cowdery” (91). Cowdery’s importance to Mormon history could not be clearer.</p>
<p>	This book also addresses a number of events and experiences in Cowdery’s professional and personal life. Significant new information is presented about Cowdery’s involvement with the financial affairs of the Kirtland Safety Society and the Bank of Monroe, as well as facts about his life working as a lawyer during the 1840s in Tiffin, Ohio. The allegation that Cowdery practiced polygamy is discussed and rejected. Two additional essays provide information about Cowdery’s wife, Elizabeth Ann Whitmer Cowdery, and about the monument built in honor of Cowdery at Richmond, Missouri, in 1911.</p>
<p>	Because this book was produced near the same time as a second bicentennial collection, entitled <em>Oliver Cowdery: Scribe, Elder, Witness</em> (published in 2006 by the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship), it is recommended that these two books be used in tandem. The 2006 volume contains seventeen additional, previously published studies. Between these two anthologies, a fairly full biography of Cowdery emerges. For example, Cowdery’s excommunication from the Church in 1838 is mentioned only in passing in the Religious Studies Center volume (because it did not happen to be examined by any of the presenters at its conference), but readers can find that event covered in the Maxwell Institute volume (282–83, 322–23). Readers can also consult Donald Q. Cannon and Lyndon W. Cook’s <em>Far West Record</em> (Deseret Book, 1983, pages 162–71) if they wonder about the details of Cowdery’s excommunication or about how best to reconcile this odd situation with one who could be considered “the co-founder of Mormonism” (15). These welcome publications give readers a better appreciation for Cowdery’s personality and his many crucial contributions to the Church. He is a fascinating figure, central to a full understanding of the earliest history of the Latter-day Saints. </p>

<p><em>When the Saints Came Marching In:<br/>A History of the Latter-day Saints in St. Louis,</em> by Fred E. Woods and Thomas L. Farmer (Orem, Utah: Millennial Press, 2009)</p>
<p>Most of our histories about Mormons in Missouri speak of dramatic events in the 1830s in the western region of the state. Congratulations to Fred Woods and Thomas Farmer for writing a history of the Latter-day Saints in St. Louis. Woods, a professor of Church History and Doctrine at BYU, and Farmer, a lifetime St. Louis resident, wrote of the LDS presence in St. Louis beginning with early missionaries in 1831 and ending with the St. Louis Stake jubilee in 2008. This book is essential reading for scholars of Mormonism seeking to understand the experience of the Latter-day Saints in St. Louis.</p>
<p> 	By using a chronological, encyclopedic approach, the authors tell of St. Louis being more than a trailhead for Latter-day Saints. They explain that the town was a refuge for Saints fleeing from Governor Boggs’s extermination order. They tell of fundraising meetings held by St. Louis citizens to aid Mormon exiles seeking relief from persecution. They describe the experience of LDS British converts in St. Louis on their twelve-day trip from New Orleans to Nauvoo. The authors include information about three to four thousand Latter-day Saints who made St. Louis their home by 1849 and of the first St. Louis Stake organized with Elder Erastus Snow presiding in 1854. They write of Snow and his successors publishing the <em>St. Louis Luminary</em> (November 22, 1854, to December 18, 1855) in an effort to keep the Saints informed of local news and emigration plans.</p>
<p>	Woods and Farmer relate many instances of a Church presence in the city throughout the remaining nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The authors tell of Brigham Young sending missionaries in 1866 to reestablish the St. Louis District and reorganize a St. Louis Branch. They write of the St. Louis World’s Fair and of LDS officials featuring Utah in their displays. They describe in detail the creation of the St. Louis Stake in 1958 and the St. Louis Temple dedication in 1997. Another valuable contribution of this work is an alphabetical index of early Latter-day Saints in St. Louis.</p>

<p><em>Utopian Communities of the Ancient World,</em> by Brent James Schmidt (Lewiston, N.Y.: Edwin Mellen Press, 2010)</p>
<p>It is often said, and not only by classicists, that in order to understand the modern world a person must learn to understand the ancient world. Fascination with antiquity has not diminished in the digital postmodern age, perhaps because people are wondering more and more what life is really all about and what chance there might now be in the age of instant worldwide communication and interdependent global economies to achieve a truly cooperative state of affairs among all peoples of the earth.</p>
<p>	Into this picture comes the work of Brent Schmidt on the use of covenantal rituals and practices by several groups in the ancient Mediterranean and the formation, organization, and actualization of their communal or utopian societies. Seeing the roles that sacred rituals played in the life of these utopian groups opens new perspectives on these ancient groups and will be of interest to many readers. The experiments of these groups were not limited to the ivory towers of philosophy. Their members moved heaven and earth to carry out their devout plans and lofty dreams.</p>
<p>	This book begins with a lengthy and engaging discussion of modern utopian communities, their successes, and failures. A former Hugh Nibley fellow, Schmidt shows that the fundamental challenges which have faced all of these societies are essentially the same, and remain the cause of basic problems and pressures still today: property, food, sex, social distinctions, political power, and religious leadership.</p>
<p>	Most significant and original is this book’s collection of ancient sources regarding the leadership and practices of these ancient utopian groups. Substantial quotes from original sources bring modern readers close to the revered teachings of these charismatic leaders.</p>
<p>	The roots of Western civilization run deep in the soils of Jewish, Greek, Roman, and Christian civilizations. This book probes some of the most remarkably idealistic experiments in the annals of history. It exposes the debt that many people today still owe to these traditions for setting the high moral tone and lifting the visionary gaze that inspires some of their most cherished personal and social aspirations. While utopia will always remain beyond human reach, even a dim and distant view of such ideals can keep communities pointed in an optimistic and desirable direction.</p>
