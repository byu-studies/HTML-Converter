<h1>The Cordwainer <em>A day on the mission</em></h1>
<p>We sagged into his slim room</p>
<p>From the dusty street, </p>
<p>His company a dirt floor and dog.</p>
<p>I had never seen a </p>
<p>Beast of such sorrow:</p>
<p>His daughter blind, his wife gone,</p>
<p>His health only a memory.</p>
<p>He knew the cobblestone miles</p>
<p>From Montevideo to Melo,</p>
<p>The enmity between flesh and field,</p>
<p>The bruised heel, the cursed climb.</p>
<p>Scraps of light shifted across</p>
<p>The floor of his shop. He offered us</p>
<p>Bread, water, a chair. I gave him ten <em>pesos,</em></p>
<p>All I had. I removed my shoes. </p>
<p>From a high shelf he chose the finest leather, </p>
<p>Then knelt and measured my bare feet, </p>
<p>And cut, stitched, glued.</p>
<p>In my stupor I saw,</p>
<p>Comprehending at last</p>
<p>The small miracle of making a life,</p>
<p>The quietude, the tuck of leather to tread.</p>
<p>After all, it wasn’t his sorrow we were meant to seek,</p>
<p>It was his hands.</p>
<p>—Terresa Wellborn</p>
