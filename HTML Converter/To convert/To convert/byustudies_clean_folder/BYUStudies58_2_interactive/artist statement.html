<h1>Ed’s Slot, Provo River</h1>
<p class="author">Jan Perkins</p>
<p>The oil painting <em>Ed’s Slot, Provo River</em> is 34<em>"</em> × 40<em>"</em> on linen canvas and was completed in 1994.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">I had painted a few fly-fishing paintings prior to this one. I was interested in capturing the brilliant light of sunset as it shines up Provo Canyon at the height of autumn color. I asked my friend Sean, who fishes the river a lot, if he would model for the painting. He eagerly agreed and then bought the original painting. I wanted my painting to be authentic, so Sean taught me a little bit about currents and the textures they make on the river and where to cast a line.</p>
