<h1>Back</h1>
<p>In early morning, as you run down the hall</p>
<p>tumbling over the rug, clutching a stuffed animal,</p>
<p>I can’t help but toss you over my shoulder,</p>
<p>your fly-away curls blind</p>
<p>both of us, your squeals sling down</p>
<p>my ear, the notes peal</p>
<p>sharper than winter air.</p>
<p>You hop down and toe into the kitchen,</p>
<p>pleased that I now understand your raised finger,</p>
<p>your whispered plea cup of milk, cup of milk.</p>
<p>You came into our lives like a bird</p>
<p>flying out of a magician’s fiery pot.</p>
<p>Your wings and rhythms forming somewhere else.</p>
<p>What did you do with what you left behind?</p>
<p>Are scarves and jump ropes winding you</p>
<p>through an antemortal wormhole or tipping point?</p>
<p>For you, the only tip is a head moving forward,</p>
<p>no going back to a fist in the mouth</p>
<p>or smacking gums or cells quick</p>
<p>to divide.</p>
<p>Yet occasionally I go back,</p>
<p>attempting to piece together</p>
<p>your essence with the verbal splashes</p>
<p>I hear now.</p>
<p>How a blueprint exists for each house</p>
<p>and a mathematician knows the endlessness of a line.</p>
<p>Even when you aren’t here,</p>
<p>I still hear footsteps down the hall.</p>
<p>—Mark D. Bennion</p>
