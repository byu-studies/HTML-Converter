<h1><em>Foundational Texts of Mormonism: Examining Major Early Sources,</em> edited by Mark Ashurst-McGee, Robin Scott Jensen, and Sharalyn D. Howcroft (New York: Oxford University Press, 2018)</h1>
<p>At first glance, the title of this work may imply it is a documentary history project, but in fact, Mark Ashurst-McGee, Robin Scott Jensen, and Sharalyn D. Howcroft have not compiled a collection of documents, but rather a series of essays by other scholars (with the exception of Howcroft who includes her own entry in the volume) <em>about</em> these foundational documents. The editors lay out the purpose of the book, which “insists on the importance of taking a closer look at the essential texts that historians use to reconstruct the founding era of the Church” (1). They further state that since these major sources have been used and will continue to be used extensively by writers, these texts need to be understood and viewed with a more critical eye.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The editors begin their introduction crediting Dean C. Jessee’s landmark work in the 1970s as the start of the present compilation. Jessee (to whom the volume itself is dedicated) discovered that the <em>History of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, by Himself,</em> was actually largely compiled by scribes and assistants and was not, in fact, written by Joseph at all, though the project was certainly under his direction. Ashurst-McGee, Jensen, and Howcroft then appropriately recognize that “while the complex production of Joseph Smith’s history may make it the archetypical example of the need to understand how and when and by whom a document was created, there are several other foundational sources, used frequently by those researching and writing in early Mormon history, that are not what they appear to be on their face” (4). Their volume reviews these “other foundational sources” and offers greater context to their creation and subsequent publication and reception (4).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">After the introduction, the book includes twelve essays by various scholars in the field. The shortest two essays are twenty-three pages long, and the longest is an impressive forty pages. Additionally, there are illustrations, maps, and facsimiles of some of the documents discussed. Beginning with Richard Lyman Bushman’s “The Gold Plates as Foundational Text,” these essays proceed more or less in chronological order. Bushman reminds his readers that the entire project of the Book of Mormon, like the project of the early Saints, was a human one. Though the Book of Mormon prophets claimed divine inspiration, ultimately it was their imperfect fingers that inscribed the text, just as it was the determined but flawed hands and hearts of the early Saints who carried the fledgling faith past the martyrdom and into the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Next in line, Grant Hardy builds on Royal Skousen’s textual work of the Book of Mormon in “Textual Criticism and the Book of Mormon,” followed by Thomas A. Wayment’s “Intertextuality and the Purpose of Joseph Smith’s New Translation of the Bible,” in which Wayment posits the possibility that the Book of Moses was the catalyst for the New Testament translation, which led to Smith’s Christianization of the Old Testament and a comprehensive harmonization of the Bible with his developing theology. Grant Underwood then moves away from translation to oral tradition in his “The Dictation, Compilation, and Canonization of Joseph Smiths’ Revelations.” Underwood focuses his essay on Joseph Smith’s dictation of revelations that were later canonized as sections in the Doctrine and Covenants. Underwood demonstrates that Joseph considered these revelations to be works in progress, based on the imperfect nature of dictation and the work of mortal scribes, which necessitated corrections. “The texts of his [Joseph’s] reve­la­tions,” Underwood notes, “were not understood as infallible texts written in stone by the finger of God; they came instead through a finite and fallible prophet who, along with his associates, was not shorn of his humanity in exercising his prophetic office” (122). David W. Grua, Jennifer Reeder, and William V. Smith then each have a piece reviewing Joseph’s letters from Liberty Jail, the Female Relief Society minute book, and the difficulties documenting Joseph’s sermons, respectively. Alex D. Smith and Andrew H. Hedges include a section, “Joseph Smith’s Nauvoo Journals,” further exploring the challenges of reading a work of history not written by the subject.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The final four essays begin with ­Laurel Thatcher Ulrich’s “The Early Diaries of Wilford Woodruff, 1835–1839,” in which she discusses the earliest entries of Woodruff’s journal and how they reflected not only his sensibilities but also the diarist conventions widely employed by his contemporaries. Howcroft maintains in her chapter, “A Textual and Archival Reexamination of Lucy Mack Smith’s History,” that the same careful examination of Joseph Smith’s published history (as demonstrated by Jessee) should be applied to Lucy Mack Smith’s history of Joseph Smith. The creation and production of Lucy’s history is just as complex and varied and her son’s. Jeffrey G. Cannon then offers a discussion on an understudied format in Latter-day Saint textual criticism: the image. Cannon specifically shows how Latter-day Saint leaders used images to support their succession claims in opposition to the RLDS movement. Ronald O. Barney concludes the collection with a portrait of Joseph Smith himself and his personality, which may have influenced why he recorded so little of his own thoughts and speeches.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0"><em>Foundational Texts of Mormonism</em> presents for the scholar and the casual reader added context and understanding to the various receptions of these texts over time. The individual essays are valuable to any study of the texts they examine while also being fine examples of several different types of textual criticism in their own right.</p>

<h1><em>Abinadi: He Came among Them in Disguise,</em> edited by Shon D. Hopkin (Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University; Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2018)</h1>
<p>This volume, which examines the Book of Mormon story of Abinadi, is the first volume generated by the Book of Mormon Academy, “an academic think tank and research group begun . . . to promote scholarship and teaching on the Book of Mormon” (vi). Scholars in this group “primarily pursue their own research agendas,” but sometimes they produce studies “that can be combined into one volume” such as this one (vi).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The chapters are organized into four groups, each bringing different “lenses” to bear on the text. The first group applies “literary lenses” to the Abinadi story. Jared W. Ludlow, Daniel L. Belnap, and Frank F. Judd Jr., in their respective chapters, analyze narrative features of the text that bring to light subtle ideological tensions over Nephite identity and the interpretation of Isaiah. These papers largely build on previous works about the Abinadi account by scholars such as Dana M. Pike, John W. Welch, and Joseph M. Spencer.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The second group utilizes “intertextual and intratextual lenses” to add insight to Abinadi’s words and their impact among later Nephite prophets. Here John Hilton III traces connections between Abinadi’s words and those of King Benjamin, Amulek, Alma, and Mormon, while Nicholas J. Frederick examines New Testament language that shows up in Abinadi’s discourse. Shon D. Hopkin looks closely at Abinadi’s quotations from Exodus 20 and Isaiah 53, analyzing the textual variants found here and in other ancient textual witnesses. In his chapter, Hopkin engages with past studies of the Isaiah variants by David P. Wright and John A. Tvedtnes. For another study relevant to such language studies, readers may want to reference David Larsen’s article on death being “swallowed up” (“Death Being Swallowed Up in Netzach in the Bible and the Book of Mormon,” <em>BYU Studies Quarterly</em> 55, no. 4 [2016]: 123–34).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The third section features two papers examining the Abinadi narrative through “cultural-historical lenses.” Kerry Hull discusses the connotations of a disastrous “east wind” in biblical and ancient Near Eastern traditions as well as in Mesoamerica. Mark Alan Wright, cowriting with Hull, compares the killing of Abinadi to numerous accounts of torturing and killing captives from both pre- and post-Columbian sources in Meso- and North America. Wright and Hull significantly expand on past works by Robert J. Matthews and Brant A. Gardner. Generally speaking, however, possible Mesoamerican connections to the Abinadi story remain an area for further exploration.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">In the fourth section, the story of Abinadi is looked at through “theological lenses.” Amy Easton-Flake considers the issue of infant salvation in the Book of Mormon, first (chronologically) mentioned by Abinadi, and also in light of nineteenth-century debates about infant salvation and baptism. Finally, following similar efforts in Pauline scholarship, Joseph M. Spencer provides a philosophical and theological analysis of Abinadi’s “as though” statements in Mosiah 16:5–6.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The volume concludes with two appendices. A “critical text” of Mosiah 11–17, compiled by all the members of the Book of Mormon Academy, uses the 1840 edition of the Book of Mormon as the base text and provides over seven hundred footnotes highlighting textual variants, intertextual relationships, and unique phrases. A true testament to the diligent work of the contributors, this resource will prove useful to students and scholars alike. The second appendix provides a bibliography of much of the previous Abinadi scholarship that many of the papers build on.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Overall, this book provides a close look at the narrative about the prophet Abinadi from a variety of angles, building on and engaging with past scholarship and forging ahead into uncharted territory. Informed Latter-day Saints interested in deeper study of the Book of Mormon, as well academics of all kinds who are interested in serious engagement with the Book of Mormon, should be interested in this volume.</p>

<h1><em>Saints, Slaves, and Blacks: The Changing Place of Black People within Mormonism,</em> by Newell G. Bringhurst, 2d ed. (Salt Lake City: Greg Kofford Books, 2018)</h1>
<p><em>Saints, Slaves, and Blacks</em> draws on historical and scriptural sources to examine the history of Latter-day Saint thought regarding blacks. Author ­Newell Bringhurst notes that when the first edition of the book was published in 1981, “it attracted limited notice both within and outside the Mormon community.” Bringhust chalks the oversight up to bad timing—it was published just three years after the 1978 revelation lifting the priesthood ban, when “Mormons of all stripes” were “­anxious to move on, focused on embracing their black brethren and sisters as ecclesiastical equals while ignoring the Church’s recently abandoned practice of black priesthood denial and prohibition on African-American entry into the temple” (xvi). Because of the book’s relatively limited circulation, this second edition is intended to make Bringhurst’s groundbreaking work available to wider audiences and introduce it to a new generation of readers.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The book is divided into nine chapters, which trace chronologically the place of blacks within the Church and its culture from 1820 to 1980, covering such topics as slavery, abolition, the priesthood denial, and civil rights. This new edition is largely unchanged from the first, with only minor adjustments made such as spelling corrections, repagi­na­tion, reformatting, and an updated bibliographic essay. The book also includes a new preface from the author outlining the history of his creation of the book and its role within contemporary studies of race and the Latter-day Saint religion. Also added is a new foreword by Edward J. Blum and two postscripts by, respectively, Paul Reeve and Darron T. Smith—two scholars of race and Latter-day Saint religion.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Given the timing of the first edition and the book’s own focus (at least four of the nine chapters, plus an epilogue, deal directly with the priesthood denial), those who read the book in 1981 “primarily viewed it in terms of the 1978 ending of the priesthood ban on black men” (ix). It is fitting then that the book was reissued in the same year as the fortieth anniversary of the revelation that lifted the ban.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">In addition to commemorating the anniversary of this historic moment, the new edition of this book is relevant for other reasons. Despite the passing of almost forty years, issues of race in America and religion are as salient and relevant today as they were then. As one of the first book-length studies of blacks in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-­day Saints, this study, according to Blum, was “ahead of its time” (ix). With this book, for example, and “its central thesis that the ban emerged largely as the byproduct of Mormon ethnic whiteness” (xvi), Bring­hust articulates a theory of “whiteness,” a topic and analytical approach that has since become a major focus in critical race studies. And Bringhurst’s commentary holds particular currency within contemporary academic conversations of blacks within the Latter-day Saint faith. Indeed, its thesis of a “Mormon whiteness” has been reiterated in several studies of the last decades, including in the recent publications <em>Religion of a Different Color: Race and the Mormon Struggle for Whiteness</em> by W. Paul Reeve and <em>Race and the Making of the Mormon People</em> by Max Perry Mueller.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">As Blum notes, <em>Saints, Slaves, and Blacks</em> “is a book to mind and to mine” (ix), and it will be of value to any person interested in such broad topics as American religious history and the history of race in America and in religious thought. But the book will be of most interest to Latter-day Saints who wish for a deep dive into the changing status of blacks in the Church and the culture surrounding the religion.</p>

<h1><em>The Worldwide Church: Mormonism as a Global Religion,</em> edited by Michael A. Goodman and Mauro Properzi (Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University; Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2016)<a id="_idTextAnchor001"></a></h1>
<p>Since 1981, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has experienced a dramatic increase in membership outside of the United States and Canada (vii–xii). As a result, in March 2014, Brigham Young University and the Church History Department sponsored a Church history symposium titled <em>The Worldwide Church: The Global Reach of Mormonism.</em> The symposium invited scholars to address subjects related to the increasingly global nature of the Church.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">After the symposium, Michael A. Goodman and Mauro Properzi, associate professors of Church history at Brigham Young Unversity, edited nineteen of the presentations and published them in the compilation <em>The Worldwide Church: Mormonism as a Global Religion.</em> The compilation is bookended by the keynote addresses of Apostle Dieter F. Uchtdorf and Terryl L. Givens, and in between are papers by several prominent scholars. The editors conveniently organized the articles into five sections, each dedicated to a specific region in the world: Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Europe, and South and Central America. Another article, along with Givens’s speech, appears in a sixth section titled “Worldwide.”</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The included articles address a wide range of topics related to the global Church, from the development of Latter-day Saint humanitarian aid to country-specific studies. Some articles provide a history of the establishment and growth of the Church in a specific area (such as Afghanistan, Taiwan, and Latin America), while others discuss significant moments in Church history (such as the era of “the freeze” in Ghana). And others analyze some of the cultural problems Church members have faced (such as cultural challenges in Europe and language obstacles in Russia). All of the articles work together to provide a greater understanding of global Latter-day Saint topics.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Anyone who is interested in Church history and the growing global nature of the Church will enjoy reading this compilation. Scholarship such as this will only become more relevant and important as the Church continues to expand throughout the world.</p>

<h1><em>Pioneer Women of Arizona,</em> by Roberta Flake Clayton, Catherine H. Ellis, and David F. Boone, 2d ed.<em> </em>(Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University; Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2017)<a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a></h1>
<p>Roberta Flake Clayton self-published <em>Pioneer Women of Arizona </em>in 1969 after spending thirty-three years conducting numerous interviews and cataloguing over two hundred biographical sketches of the pioneer women, both old and young, who, beginning in the nineteenth century, came to Arizona by wagon or train and settled communities such as Phoenix, Mesa, Snowflake, Flagstaff, and Prescott.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Her work fell by the wayside until Catherine H. Ellis (a fifth-generation Arizonian and BYU graduate) and David F. Boone (an educator and historian) revived the work, creating a second edition with added footnotes, maps, a biography of Roberta Clayton, a history of Latter-day Saint migration to Arizona, and hundreds of photographs.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The 207 biographical sketches featured in <em>Pioneer Women of Arizona </em>are very detailed and comprehensive. In creating these sketches, Clayton’s goal was to preserve their stories, including the stories of women Clayton knew personally, and to give younger generations role models to look up to.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The fact that she decided to specifically focus on women adds to the value of this work, since women have often been underrepresented in mainstream historical narratives. Although she was encouraged to make the scope of her work “more universal,” Clayton decided to focus on women because of their great faith and resourcefulness in obeying their Church leaders and settling an area far from civilization (29).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Clayton originally dedicated this work to “the descendants of the noble women who pioneered the West” (iii), but this work is more than a genealogist’s gold mine—it is a treasure for all those interested in the history of Arizona, the history of the Latter-day Saints, women’s studies, and stories of faith. </p>
