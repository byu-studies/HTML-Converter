<h1><em>“To Seek the Law of the Lord”: Essays in Honor of John W. Welch,</em> edited by Paul Y. Hoskisson and Daniel C. Peterson (Orem, Utah: The Interpreter Foundation, 2017)</h1>
<p><em>To Seek the Law of the Lord</em> is a collection of twenty essays, composing over five hundred pages of Latter-day Saint scholarship. The collection is a tribute to John W. Welch, who established the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies in 1989 and served as editor-in-chief of BYU Studies from 1991 to 2018. Welch has published extensively (521), making significant contributions with his studies on, for example, chiasmus in the Book of Mormon and law in the Bible. This collection was organized and edited by Paul Y. Hoskisson and Daniel C. Peterson, who are both associates of Welch. All contributing authors to <em>To Seek the Law of the Lord</em> have worked with and been influenced by Welch and his work.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The essays within <em>To Seek the Law of the Lord </em>contain a wide variety of topics, including world and Latter-day Saint history; analyses of the Book of Mormon, Bible, and other scripture; and theological and sociotheological discussions. One such essay, “Notes on Mormonism and the Trinity” by Daniel C. Peterson (267), explains the intricate history of trinitarian theology. In “Faith, Hope, and Charity: The ‘Three Principal Rounds’ of the Ladder of Heavenly Ascent,” author Jeffrey M. Bradshaw writes, “The scriptural triad of faith, hope, and charity should be understood as something more than a general set of personal attributes” (59). Bradshaw then takes the reader on a journey through the scriptures and shows the reader that faith, hope, and charity are at the very core of Latter-day Saint doctrine and the path to salvation.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Other essays, reflecting the breadth of Welch’s work, include “Transcendance of the Flesh, Divine and Human” by James E. Faulconer (113), “The Visions of Moses and Joseph Smith’s Bible Translation” by Kent P. Jackson (161), “Toqueville on New Prophets and the Tyrrany of Public Opinion” by Louis Midgley (171), “Chiastic Structuring of Large Texts: Second Nephi as a Case Study” by Noel B. Reynolds (333), and “Tree of Life, Tree of Healing” by John Tvedtnes (495).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0"><em>To Seek the Law of the Lord</em> will appeal to those who have appreciated Welch’s work over the years and wish to see how his scholarship has been applied by other academics. It will also be of value to those seeking higher levels of understanding on the topics found therein. The writing and information presented are quite intricate, so one should not expect light reading from the compilation. With the collection’s range of topics, however, it will have something of interest for most readers.</p>

<h1><em>Name as Key-Word: Collected Essays on Onomastic Wordplay and the Temple in </em><em>Mormon Scripture </em>by Matthew L. Bowen (Orem, Utah: Interpreter Foundation; Salt Lake City: Eborn Books, 2018)</h1>
<p>The ancient world’s use of names to represent meanings, symbols, prophecies, and memorials is foreign to us today, and Matthew Bowen’s book bridges that gap to tell us what we can learn from understanding the use of names in ancient scriptural narratives. The volume’s sixteen essays delve into the names of persons and places in the Book of Mormon and Bible. Bowen’s thorough and careful research into these names provides helpful background for these scriptural texts: for example, the essay on the place names <em>Zarahemla</em> and <em>Jershon</em> draws parallels between these names and a naming practice in the Bible seen in place names like <em>Salem, Bethel,</em> and <em>Hormah.</em> The chapter on Peter and his surname seeks to correct the misunderstanding that Peter is the rock and foundation of the Church; rather, it is Christ himself. Readers interested specifically in temple studies will enjoy the chapter on the Jerusalem temple. In that chapter, Bowen analyzes place names, exploring how theophany and sacrifice converge at this specific place and examining the etiological narratives of Abraham and Isaac to show that “the temple itself was, and is, Christ’s Atonement having its intended effect on humanity” (lvii).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">This book will serve readers who love scriptural etymology and those who desire a detailed study of ancient scripture. Matthew Bowen is an assistant professor in Religious Education at Brigham Young University and has contributed to the Book of Mormon Onomasticon (https://onoma.lib.byu.edu). His expertise in ancient languages might have resulted in his writing an impenetrable text, but he helps the reader by offering explanations and commentary that clearly outline why these names matter. Earlier versions of most of the essays in this volume can be found on the <em>Interpreter</em>’s website, but having them together in print in a nicely formatted book is worth the cost.</p>

<h1><em>The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, Maxwell Institute Study Edition,</em> edited by Grant Hardy (Provo, Utah: Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship, 2018)</h1>
<p>The Maxwell Institute’s study edition of the Book of Mormon is both an update and an expansion of Grant Hardy’s <em>The Book of Mormon: A Reader’s Edition,</em> published in 2003 by the University of Illinois Press. Among the many differences between the two volumes, I find two most significant. First, the base text for the Maxwell Institute edition is the 2013 version of the Book of Mormon, used currently by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. <em>A Reader’s Edition</em> used the 1920 version because it was the most recent edition available in the public domain. The Church obviously granted Hardy and the Maxwell Institute permission to use the text of its current official version for this study edition, which gives the volume a silent stamp of approval by the Church that <em>A Reader’s Edition</em> did not enjoy. Textually, this is significant only because of a few editorial changes that have occurred since 1920. For the vast majority of verses, however, the text is identical.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The second significant difference is Hardy’s inclusion of footnotes containing many simplified examples of textual variants presented in detail by Royal Skousen in <em>Analysis of Textual Variants,</em> volume 4 of his Book of Mormon Critical Text Project. Other footnotes offer a variety of explanations and brief commentary on the text. The footnotes, however, are not excessive, usually numbering fewer than five per page.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">As with <em>A Reader’s Edition,</em> the Maxwell Institute’s study edition attempts to make the text more accessible by presenting it in paragraphs, with poetry set in verse form. Explanatory headers, running heads, and subheads help guide the reader through the twists and turns of the Book of Mormon narrative. The text itself appears in roman typeface, while study helps are in italics, and boldface type occasionally identifies intertextuality with the Bible or within the Book of Mormon itself.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Art by Brian Kershisnik appears at the beginning of each book in this study edition. The contrast between Kershisnik’s style and Arnold Friberg’s, which most Latter-day Saints likely associate with the Book of Mormon, is stark but thought-provoking. Kershisnik’s choice of images is more subtle and contemplative, and all images are printed in black and white.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">I was surprised to find two minor factual errors in the editor’s introduction to the volume. Let me mention one. Hardy explains that the original manuscript instead of the printer’s manuscript was used by the typesetter (for text from Helaman 13, verse 17, to the end of Mormon) because “Joseph and Oliver took the printer’s manuscript to Canada to procure the copyright there” (xv). But Joseph Smith did not go to Canada with Oliver Cowdery. In the revelation regarding this errand to Canada, Oliver’s traveling companions were to be Hiram Page, Josiah Stowell, and Joseph Knight. It is uncertain whether all three accompanied Oliver, but Joseph Smith definitely did not.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-000" id="footnote-000-backlink">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">This quibble aside, the <em>Maxwell Institute Study Edition</em> of the Book of Mormon is a valuable addition to the growing number of resources available to students of this volume of Latter-day Saint scripture.</p>

<h1><em>Kalaupapa: The Mormon Experience in an Exiled Community</em> by Fred E. Woods (Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University; Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2017) </h1>
<p>As Hansen’s Disease (also known as leprosy) spread rapidly throughout Hawaii in the nineteenth century, the Kalaupapa peninsula was selected as an “isolation settlement for confirmed cases” of leprosy and the location of “a receiving hospital where suspected cases could be treated” (20–21). These individuals were essentially exiled, and one might think that such an isolated community would be a place of loneliness, but <em>Kalaupapa: The Mormon Experience in an Exiled Community</em> explores how, instead, the community was built on love and inclusion and began to thrive and became a sacred space. According to author Fred E. Woods, professor of religious education at Brigham Young University, Kalaupapa “is the story of community—community unlike anywhere else in the world—not a space divided by borders and barriers or fences and enclosures, but a place which beckons every race and religion, every color and creed” (xv). </p>
<p class="indent-1-0">This book stands out from others written about Kalaupapa because it “emphasizes the Mormon experience” (xv). It begins by giving a brief history of Hawaii and the first Christian ministers (including Protestant, Catholic, and Latter-day Saint missionaries) to arrive there. The book then dives into stories of the inhabitants of Kalaupapa and the experiences of Church members there from the nineteenth century through the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Included in the book’s 318 pages are over one hundred images, most of Church members and natives of Kalaupapa, which help bring to life the history Woods tells. Several appendixes supplement the narrative and feature the complete text of several primary documents, including the official acts that isolated those with leprosy, letters sent between Church leaders and the king of Hawaii, and records of the local branch presidency.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">According to Woods, “The charity and uncommon service rendered at Kalaupapa is relevant in any age” (xvii). Anyone interested in the power of community and in global Church history will find this a compelling and satisfying read.</p>
