<h1><em>Talking Doctrine: Mormons and Evangelicals in Conversation</em>, edited by Richard J. Mouw and Robert L. Millet (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 2015)</h1>
<p>In recent years, Mormons and contemporary Christians have come together in order to better understand one another. Unexpected strides have been made in discovering the commonalities and differences that exist between both groups. A significant attempt was made in 1997 with the publishing of <em>How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and an Evangelical in Conversation </em>by Stephen Robinson and Craig Blomberg. Ten years later, Donald W. Musser (Christian scholar) and David L. Paulsen (Mormon scholar) edited a volume of essays by both Christian and Mormon scholars titled <em>Mormonism in Dialogue with Contemporary Christian Theologies</em>. </p>
<p class="indent-1-0">During the ten-year publishing span of these two seminal works, many ­others have worked and published tirelessly on interfaith relations. Two of the most prominent have been scholars Robert L. Millet (Brigham Young University) and Richard J. Mouw (Fuller Theological Seminary), who have come together to edit a compilation of essays published by InterVarsity Press. </p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The first part of <em>Talking Doctrine</em> contains stand-alone essays—by either Evangelical or Mormon scholars—about personal experiences with the fifteen-year interfaith dialogue that made this culminating work possible. Part two of the book presents essays on “specific doctrinal discussions.” Rather than impose an Evangelical or Mormon viewpoint on a particular doctrine with subsequent response essays (such as in <em>Mormonism in Dialogue</em>), each scholar represents both sides fairly and accurately in one essay on subjects such as the Trinity and becoming as God. These essays provide substantial but clear and concise summations of both viewpoints. Readers interested in what connects and separates Mormons from Evangelicals will find insight and notice a lack of hostility on every page.  </p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Both Mouw and Millet explain the origins of <em>Talking Doctrine</em> in the preface. Nine Mormon and ten Evangelical scholars met at BYU in the spring of 2000 to openly question and discuss each other’s beliefs. Many doubts and concerns existed in the attendees’ minds at this first meeting. Millet and others wondered what the whole point of it was: To convert one another? To make sure the other understood what Mormons/Evangelicals believe? As they continued to meet once or twice a year, the tensions eased, and the motivation became less about being understood and more about understanding one another (59).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Such a dialogue shows the need to walk in another religion’s shoes before attempting to represent it; the kindness and respect that flow through these pages illustrate the hard-earned right of these scholars to speak for one another. In the preface, Mouw and Millet point to another significant feat: Mormons and Evangelicals share many more core values than they realize, and it would be to their best interest to unite under the name of Christianity against the “influences in our world that threaten to tear at the very fabric of our society” (11). The book is very readable and speaks to all people, no matter the level of awareness of Christian doctrine, because all readers can benefit by improving how they approach other religions. Whatever pulls readers to engage this book, even if only curiosity, it will be worth their time.</p>

<h1><em>Conversations with Mormon Historians, </em>edited by Alexander L. Baugh and Reid L. Neilson (Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center; Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2015)</h1>
<p>“For a boy growing up on a small farm in northern Utah, it would be quite amazing if I am remembered at all. I’ve had an exciting life. In lots of ways, it’s a life I did not fully dream of when I was thinning sugar beets—better than I could have hoped, I think,” (274) writes Kenneth W. Godfrey in <em>Conversations with Mormon Historians</em> about his experience being a career historian. For the historians who work hard to ensure that people of the past are remembered, <em>Conversations with Mormon Historians</em> works hard to ensure that the historians themselves are remembered also.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">This book is a compilation of interviews with some of the eminent past-­generation Latter-day Saint historians—interviewed by some of the eminent LDS historians of this generation. Because both the interviewers and the interviewees have a deep adoration for Mormon history, the comradery between the scholars is palpable upon the book’s pages. The list of distinguished historians interviewed includes Thomas G. Alexander, James B. Allen, Richard Lloyd Anderson, Milton V. Backman, LaMar C. Berrett, Claudia L. Bushman, Richard L. Bushman, Kenneth W. Godfrey, Dean C. Jessee, Stanley B. Kimball, Carol Cornwall Madsen, Robert J. Matthews, Max H Parkin, Charles S. Peterson, Larry C. Porter, and Laurel Thatcher Ulrich. Each historian brings different interests, ideas, personalities, and experiences to the book—and each makes the book an enjoyable and enlightening read.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Each chapter focuses on a different historian and includes questions about the historian’s childhood, family, education, and career. The interviewed historians have a talent for taking the reader back in time through their stories. Milton V. Backman states, “I believe that history is fascinating because it is a series of stories. It is something more than just dates. It is life experiences. It’s unfolding the past. It’s reconstructing patterns of living” (124). These historians have lived long and full lives, and their personal narratives deeply and richly unfold the past through the pages of the book. It is appropriate to acknowledge that these historians—who have spent their lives studying the histories of others—have, in turn, made history themselves. The book is filled with funny anecdotes, impressive accomplishments, and spiritual moments. Overall, <em>Conversations with Mormon Historians</em> is an informative and light-hearted read for anyone personally interested in any aspect of history.</p>

<h1><em>Last Laborer: Thoughts and Reflections of a Black Mormon</em> by Keith N. Hamilton (Salt Lake City: Ammon Works, 2011)</h1>
<p>Somewhere between memoir and testimonial lies a category of work where an accomplished person attempts to explore the particulars of their own experience in a way that is both useful and interesting to others. Keith N. Hamilton’s <em>Last Laborer: Thoughts and Reflections of a Black Mormon</em> explores his personal history in the context of being a black convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints soon after the revelation on the priesthood was announced. The narrative neither accuses nor defends, choosing instead to simply explore how he has integrated his often difficult experience with a strong sense of identity and a hopeful faith in a clear, direct, and very readable personal voice.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The author coins the term “doc­tri­mo­nial” to describe the work, underpinning its peculiar nature as a combination memoir, doctrinal explication, and personal interpretation—a model mirrored in the book’s three sections. The first section is a memoir that explores key experiences growing up in traditional African-American culture in and around the Jim Crow South. Those challenges prepared him to hear and accept the gospel as a student at North Carolina State University—and deal with the social and cultural backlash that he felt both as he finished his undergraduate degree at NC State and as he went on (after serving an LDS mission) to the somewhat alien environment of Brigham Young University, being the first black student accepted at the J. Reuben Clark Law School. Hamilton is clear and direct about the dissonance he often felt as he tried to reconcile a gospel of peace and unity with a culture that had not yet learned to comfortably accommodate an accomplished black Mormon, particularly one with a peculiar sense of humor.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The second section lays out the commonly understood understanding of doctrine on blacks and the priesthood, then supplements it with his own hard-won understanding of that same doctrine. This section is a bit unusual in that it works to explain rather than attack or condone, and shows a remarkable charity even while exploring the mismatches between practice and preachment. Hamilton explores the historical context leading up to the revelation on the priesthood, the process of obtaining that revelation, and the sometimes harsh responses to it both inside and outside the Church. This is also where he presents and explicates the parable of the laborer as a thematic and metaphorical frame for integrating the three sections and directly addressing the ongoing challenges still faced by the Church.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The third section then goes on to show Hamilton’s personal understanding and testimony of hope, as well as his calling on the Church to embrace the challenge of building a more perfect faith with a perfect brightness of hope—difficult history and personal experience notwithstanding. His emphasis on understanding, without either condemning or condoning, reveals a strong testimony of both the gospel of Jesus Christ and its (ongoing) restoration.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0"><em>Last Laborer</em> is a powerful exploration of racial issues offered with admirable clarity, incisive wit, and a deep and abiding charity that speaks eloquently to the challenge and promise of a constant and hopeful effort to draw nearer to the truth.</p>

<p><em>The Oxford Handbook of Mormonism,</em> edited by Terryl L. Givens and Philip L. Barlow (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015)</p>
<p>The<em> Oxford Handbook </em>series publishes academic essays in particular fields within the humanities and social sciences. This volume focuses on a growing subgenre of religious studies—Mormonism. Terryl Givens and Philip Barlow have brought their considerable experience and expertise to the task of assembling and editing this collection of essays on topics about Mormon history, theology, and lived religion. Givens is a professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond and the author of several books, including <em>Wrestling the Angel: The Foundations of Mormon Thought: Cosmos, God, Humanity.</em> Barlow is a professor of Mormon history and culture at Utah State University and the author of <em>Mormons and the Bible: The Place of the Latter-day Saints in American Religion.</em> The other contributing authors serve in various academic fields, and the book includes their biographies so that the reader may better contextualize the diverse perspectives of the essayists.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0"><em>The Oxford Handbook of Mormonism</em> is organized into eight sections beginning with “History of Mormonism.” This section discusses not only the history of Mormonism, but also the development of Mormon studies as a scholarly field. Essays explore topics on Mormons in Utah and around the world, women’s relationship with the Church, and differences between Latter-day Saints and the Community of Christ. The next two sections, “Revelation and Scripture” and “Ecclesiastical Structure and Praxis,” give broad overviews of elements in the Church such as the Bible and the Book of Mormon, revelation on an individual and Church level, missionary work, the priesthood, and temples. “Mormon Thought,” the fourth section, focuses more on theology than the other sections. The doctrines of revelation, the nature of God, the Atonement, and the plan of salvation are all included. The “Mormon Society” section treats social discussions such as family structure, gender, race, politics, and lived religion. “Mormon Culture” examines popular and folk culture, the relevance of geography in Mormon culture, and relationships with art, architecture, literature, music, and media. The <em>Oxford Handbook</em> concludes with “The International Church” and “Mormonism in the World Community.” In these final two sections, Mormonism is studied in its locations in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Pacific, and also in relation to world religions, law, and politics.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0"><em>The Oxford Handbook of Mormonism</em> contributes considerably to the burgeoning field of Mormon studies. The essays are logically and neatly organized in the eight sections, yet each topic is distinct. The essays are current and should provide a valuable resource for those in Mormon studies, as well as for general readers interested in the open landscape of American and world religions. The<em> Oxford Handbook </em>is not so much a reference handbook as it is a collection of essays, editorials, and articles. This guide will give modern scholars an understanding of the status of Mormon studies today and the possibilities for where it can go in the future. </p>

<h1><em>Meine Suche nach dem lebendigen Gott: Gedanken aus dem Leben von</em> <em>F. Enzio Busche,</em> edited by Tracie A. Lamb, translated by Wolfgang Gebauer (Leipzig: Leipziger Universitätsverlag, 2015)</h1>
<p>In 2004, Deseret Book published <em>Yearning for the Living God: Reflections from the Life of F. Enzio Busche. </em>Eleven years later, this book was translated and published in German by Leipziger Universitätsverlag (Leipzig University Press), a noteworthy and perhaps unique publishing event in Latter-day Saint history. That a prestigious German university press would publish the biography of an LDS General Authority speaks volumes about the respect Elder Busche still commands in his native land.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Born in Dortmund in 1930, three years before Hitler’s rise to power, Enzio found himself at age fourteen drafted into the faltering German army. When the war ended, he, along with most of his fellow countrymen and -women, learned the horrible truth about Hitler’s Third Reich. Enzio found himself full of questions: Who is man? Is there a God? What is the purpose of life? What happens after death?</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">So began his search for the living God, which eventually brought him in contact with the Mormon missionaries. After a lengthy investigation of the Church, Enzio eventually agreed to be baptized, but only after extracting the promise that he would never have to hold a calling or give a talk. Of course these were conditions he himself outgrew, becoming in time the first German called to serve as an LDS General Authority, a calling that enabled him to speak to congregations in forty-one countries, forty-five of the fifty United States, seven Canadian provinces, and eighty cities in his native Germany.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">This biography briefly touches upon Elder Busche’s youth; devotes several chapters to his conversion, baptism, and early years as a Latter-day Saint; discusses his family and business dealings; and concludes with his experiences as a member of the First Quorum of Seventy, where he served from October 1977 until October 2000. For the first three years of this period, he served as president of the Germany Munich Mission, and from 1987 to 1989 he was president of the Frankfurt Germany Temple. A particularly moving chapter is devoted to “Die Heiligen überall in der Welt” (the Saints in All the World), detailing extraordinary experiences he shared with ordinary members of the Church during his many travels.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">This is a unique book about a unique man and is now available in his native tongue. It should be of special interest to Latter-day Saints in Germany or to those, like me, who served missions in German-speaking countries and wish to read Elder Busche’s story in the language they once spoke as representatives of the Church.</p>
