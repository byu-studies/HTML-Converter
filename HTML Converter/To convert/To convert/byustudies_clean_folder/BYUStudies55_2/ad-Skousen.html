<p>We are pleased to announce <em>The History of the Text of the Book of Mormon: Parts 1 and 2, Grammatical Variation,</em> authored by Royal Skousen with the collaboration of Stanford Carmack. These are the latest books in the Book of Mormon Critical Text Project. They comprehensively analyze every grammatical variant and basic type of editorial change in the text of the Book of Mormon, beginning with the handwritten manuscripts and considering every major printed edition. The sixty-eight grammatical sections in these books deal with the nonstandard English in the original text and how it has been emended over the years, either consciously or accidentally. These sections also compare Book of Mormon usage with usage of the King James Bible, earlier English Bible translations, and Early Modern English in general. These volumes, together with all parts of the Critical Text project, are foundational for any scholarly study of the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Royal Skousen and Stanford Carmack gave presentations about these two books on April 6, 2016. A video of their presentations is available at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMOQDJagQ8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMOQDJagQ8</a>.</p>
