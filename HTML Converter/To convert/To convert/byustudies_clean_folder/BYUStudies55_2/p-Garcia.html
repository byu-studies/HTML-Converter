<h1>On waking, He makes His bed</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><em>	John 20:7</em></p>
<p>There is one thing left to learn: the body—</p>
<p>how it feels, perfected: <em>Colder? The stone</em></p>
<p><em>perfectly Cold. Frigid. And hard. . . . No,</em></p>
<p><em>Adamantine.</em> The cloth on his face, knotty,</p>
<p>threads coarser under perfect fingers.</p>
<p>He folds it. Corner to corner, precise, symmetric.</p>
<p>(The first act of Godhood is domestic.)</p>
<p>Like manna, how those perfect linen squares</p>
<p>would show up in his drawer—an Ima’s love.</p>
<p>He counts the ragged strips, imagining</p>
<p>Lazarus, his bound head unraveling</p>
<p>like a torch, stumbling from the cave,</p>
<p>hoping for something new, less heavy.</p>
<p>Then the last—the one with blood—enclosing</p>
<p>the stain—finale of his blood—seeing:</p>
<p>a poppy: open, closed. Like the curve</p>
<p>of his palm: closed, open. The scars</p>
<p>imprinted like two coins: <em>Look,</em></p>
<p><em>Abba, remember what I’ve bought</em>. A prick</p>
<p>of relief: <em>I am still myself.</em> Wonders</p>
<p>how else they will know him, perfect? Not his</p>
<p>eyes, his gait, his voice. He is alone</p>
<p>in this perfection, this beauty: one</p>
<p>imperfect thing, indelible—his body.</p>
