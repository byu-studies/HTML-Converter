<h1>Forerunner</h1>
<p><em>As Isaiah foretold,</em></p>
<p><em>you will be the voice of one</em></p>
<p><em>crying in the wilderness:</em></p>
<p><em>Clear a path for the Lord!</em></p>
<p><em>Level a highway through this wasteland!</em></p>
<p>That is what the angel said to me</p>
<p>as I lay by my sheep in the field.</p>
<p>I had gazed long into heaven</p>
<p>absorbed by God’s operations,</p>
<p>scarcely noticing as stars began to gather</p>
<p>and join in one brilliant blaze</p>
<p>like frozen lightning.</p>
<p><em>Don’t be afraid.</em></p>
<p>Father had often told how he fell by the altar,</p>
<p>but I never understood</p>
<p>till my own heart leapt</p>
<p>like a goat at a sudden roar.</p>
<p>The messenger spoke his piece untroubled,</p>
<p>told me who I would become.</p>
<p>But who am I?</p>
<p>Not one anointed,</p>
<p>not great like Isaiah or Elijah,</p>
<p>not a worker of miracles.</p>
<p>I have not so much as raised a single lamb</p>
<p>from death.</p>
<p>I am only a boy of the desert</p>
<p>who throws loud shouts across the emptiness</p>
<p>like stones from David’s sling,</p>
<p>warning of snakes and wolves,</p>
<p>looming storms,</p>
<p>wildfires in the underbrush.</p>
<p>—Merrijane Rice</p>
