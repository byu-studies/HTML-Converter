<h1>Green Things</h1>
<p>Faith, they say, is a seed that grows. </p>
<p>It swells, and as a mother I can say</p>
<p>that things inside swelling are not always </p>
<p>pleasant. But what sort of growing is always pleasant?</p>
<p>It swells. And as a mother, let me say—</p>
<p>growing things can pierce inside, an ache most</p>
<p>pleasant, but what sort of growing is always pleasant? </p>
<p>Blood happens, and ribs crack as time passes. </p>
<p>Growing things can pierce inside, an ache most</p>
<p>trying. Young things can die and be cut off</p>
<p>as blood happens. And ribs may crack as time passes</p>
<p>and thorns pierce through. A young plant is fragile. </p>
<p>Even in trying, young things can die and be cut off</p>
<p>when waves of pain move through you, as your insides hurt</p>
<p>with thorns piercing through. A young plant is fragile</p>
<p>and if you hold back the water, it will soon die back. </p>
<p>When waves of pain pass through you, when your insides hurt</p>
<p>because you have been stretched too far to keep</p>
<p>giving forth your waters, the bud will soon die back. </p>
<p>It will soon seem to die, but anything green lives still. </p>
<p>Because you have been stretched too far to keep</p>
<p>a bud alive over winters of creeping doubt</p>
<p>it will soon seem to die. But anything green lives still</p>
<p>and if you see green in the stem you cut, it lives. </p>
<p>A plant that lives over winters of creeping doubt</p>
<p>is a things that can still grow. <em>Cut it. Cut it. </em></p>
<p>If you see green in the stem you cut, it lives. </p>
<p><em>If you see that green inside, the Word still lives. </em></p>
<p>—Sarah Dunster</p>
