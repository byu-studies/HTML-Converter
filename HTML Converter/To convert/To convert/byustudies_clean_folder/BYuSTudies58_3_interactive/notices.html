<h1>Devery S. Anderson, ed., <em>Salt Lake School of the Prophets, 1867–1883</em> (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2018)</h1>
<p>In 1833, Joseph Smith established the first School of the Prophets in Kirtland, Ohio. The school was a place where men in the Church of Christ, founded by Smith in 1830, met to learn about spiritual and secular matters and to prepare for missionary work. During these meetings, Joseph Smith saw many visions and received revelation. The Kirtland school ended in 1837, but thirty years later, Brigham Young revived the School of the Prophets in Utah. This school was called the Salt Lake School of the Prophets and is the main subject of Devery Anderson’s new book <em>Salt Lake School of the Prophets, 1867–1883.</em></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Devery Anderson is the marketing manager at Signature Books and has previously published on Latter-day Saint history: he was an editor of a three-book documentary series: <em>Joseph Smith’s Quorum of the Anointed, 1842–1845</em>;<em> The Nauvoo Endowment Companies, 1845–1846</em>; and <em>The Development of LDS ­Temple Worship, 1846–2000 </em>(Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2005, 2005, and 2011 respectively). Anderson’s new book, <em>Salt Lake School of the Prophets, </em>is another documentary work, which reproduces the minutes kept at the meetings of the School of the Prophets led first by Brigham Young and later by John Taylor.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Instead of focusing on spiritual and secular education (like the Kirtland school), the Salt Lake City School of the Prophets met to discuss doctrine and theological questions, oversee local political and economic matters, and formulate strategies to combat some of the political, social, and economic issues of the day. Some of these issues included conflicts with people in the community who were not members of the Church, relationships with American Indians, the completion of the transcontinental railroad, and protests against the communal economy the Church was trying to enforce in the region. The school also dealt with new movements created both by and against the Church, conflicts between the Church and missionaries from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and the battle between the federal government and the Church over polygamy. The decisions made in these meetings had a notable impact on The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as well as Utah Territory. </p>
<p class="indent-1-0">After the school shut down in 1874, President John Taylor was inspired to reconvene the school in 1883. After the first couple of meetings of the revived school, however, it ended, as did another school that had been established in St. George, Utah. Anderson speculates that these schools shut down so soon because federal government investigations made it dangerous for the General Authorities to meet together (xx).</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">In the book, the minutes from the meetings held by the schools are split into seven time periods: 1867–69, 1870, 1871, 1872, 1873, 1874, and 1883. The book also includes an introduction, thirty-three pages of biographical sketches of members of the Salt Lake school, photographs, and five appendixes detailing the rules observed by the first class of the School of the Prophets, the trial of William S. Godbe and Elias L. T. Harrison, minutes of the Salt Lake United Order in 1874, meetings held by the St. George School of the Prophets in 1883, and Brigham Young’s discourse on December 20, 1867.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0"><em>Salt Lake School of the Prophets</em> is a good read for anyone interested in Church history and the political environment of nineteenth-century Utah. There is much to learn from the meetings held by the different itereations of the school and the changes that Church leaders made in the community as a result.</p>

<h1><em>Alexander Campbell and Joseph Smith: Nineteenth-Century Restorationists </em>by RoseAnn Benson (Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, in cooperation with Abilene Christian University, 2017)</h1>
<p>RoseAnn Benson’s latest book, <em>Alexander </em><em>Campbell and Joseph Smith, </em>examines and compares two of the most prominent restorationist leaders in nineteenth-­century America. On this subject, Latter-day Saints are likely most familiar with the conflict between the two men and their movements. Early Latter-day Saint Sidney Rigdon, for instance, was one of several individuals who defected from Campbell’s Disciples of Christ and joined what became The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And Campbell later published a treatise, “Delusions,” against Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon. Though these facts are relatively well known among Latter-day Saints, that story is incomplete.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Benson’s book not only places these points of conflict in context but also, especially for Latter-day Saint readers, tells a more complete story of Alexander Campbell and brings insight into Smith’s story by examining his belief systems and work in light of Campbell’s own restorationist movement.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Despite having distinct differences, these individuals had much in common, as the book discusses. Both led religious movements indigenous to America and believed in the need for a restoration of true Christianity. They also both worked on emending scripture and influenced the future religious landscape of America.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Notably, the book was published by Brigham Young University in concert with the Abilene Christian University (a Christian institution of the Campbell faith tradition), reflecting an effort to bring two faiths together to tell history. The book also features two forewords: one written by Thomas H. Olbricht, a Churches of Christ scholar; and one by Robert L. Millet, a Latter-day Saint scholar.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Comprising about four hundred pages, the book is roughly divided into fourteen chapters. The chapters are organized into an introductory section followed by four other sections. The chapters in the introductory section review the history of early American Christianity and the early lives and influences of both Campbell and Smith. The first section of the main body “explores the meanings of Christian restoration, primitivism, and millennialism and how Campbell’s and Smith’s movements fit or did not fit into these categories” (5). Section 2, “Systems of Belief,” discusses each religious leader’s foundational beliefs by exploring, in part, three documents from Campbell that reveal his theology, Smith’s Articles of Faith, and each ­leader’s work on emending the Bible.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The third section reviews instances of conflict between Smith and Campbell, and the final section discusses Campbell’s and Smith’s “distinctive contributions to restorationism” (6). Finally, two appendixes present, respectively, the full text of “Delusions” and the constitution of the Mahoning Baptist Association, for which Sidney Rigdon was an early leader, before he left that faith.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The book’s contextualization of the Latter-day Saint faith as an American restorationaist movement, its analysis of primary documents, and its balanced discussion of both history and theology make the book a valuable scholarly contribution to early American religious history. The work is laudable for bringing two traditions together and aiming to examine both fairly. With this effort, writes Olbricht, Benson’s work “will be a prolegomenon to any future study on the subject at hand” (xiii).</p>
