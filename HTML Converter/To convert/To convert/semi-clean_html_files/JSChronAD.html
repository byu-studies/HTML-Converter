<p class="Title">Joseph Smith Chronology at http://www.jschronology.byustudies.byu.edu</p>
<p class="Paragraph-Style-First">Joseph Smith’s remarkable life is here recorded as a sequence that can be searched by date (year or month) or by category tags (personal life, visions and revelations, writings, ecclesiastical duties, legal events, travels, and political events). The chronology lists events that can be tied to specific days or months. Each entry contains a brief summary along with references for further information.</p>
<p class="footnote-body">Joseph’s experiences were expansive, and this chronology is evidence of the energetic pace and broad scope of concerns that characterized Joseph’s daily activities. We hope that this chronology will be a useful resource that will place events in context of his circumstances and reveal connections and patterns.</p>
<p class="footnote-body">The chronology is now updated to reflect new information revealed by the Joseph Smith Papers project.</p>
