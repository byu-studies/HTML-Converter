<p class="document-title">How Universal Is Salvation?</p>
<p class="author">Terryl L. Givens</p>
<p>One way of making sense of Latter-day Saint heterodoxy—its location outside the spectrum of mainstream, historic Christianity—is to envision it as the culmination of early Christian trends that were suppressed or reconfigured in the early centuries of the new faith. In other words, one could see the Restoration as a road of Christian development not taken. After all, holds the great historian Walter Bauer, heresy is merely the orthodoxy that lost out.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-031" id="footnote-031-backlink">1</a></sup> One scholar of early Christianity observes that the twin condemnation of Pelagius and Origen, church fathers of the third and fourth centuries, ensured the supremacy in the Christian tradition of a “theology whose central concerns were human sinfulness, not human potentiality; divine determination, not human freedom and responsibility.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-030" id="footnote-030-backlink">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Few theologians would do more to celebrate human possibilities and inherent worth than <a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>Origen. In significant ways, he espoused core principles that would fall by the wayside along the highway of Christian development, only to be restored by Joseph Smith more than a thousand years later. Born in the late second century, this scholar from Alexandria authored the very first treatise of Christian theology—<em>On First Principles.</em> Several of his teachings have a familiar ring for Latter-day Saints. In contrast to the God of the creeds, having neither body, parts, nor passions, Origen proclaimed, “The Father himself is not impassible. If he is besought he shows pity and compassion; he feels . . . the passion of love . . . and for us men he endures the passions of mankind.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-029" id="footnote-029-backlink">3</a></sup> Pondering the origin of the human soul, Origen held that we all existed as spirit beings in a premortal world. He erred, from a Latter-day Saint perspective, in assuming that premortal error was the cause of our expulsion from <a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a>heaven, but he correctly ascertained our habitation in those celestial spheres long before birth. Seeing a destiny of endless progress in store, he referred to “the souls of men [who] in consequence of their progress, we see taken up into the order of angels.” He also taught a doctrine of apokatastasis, or full restoration. By this he meant that God would find a way to redeem and exalt the entire <a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>human family, bringing them back into the presence of God. He saw mortality as the crucial second stage in an ongoing saga of eternal <a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>progression.</p>
<blockquote>The saints as they depart from this life will remain in some place situated on this earth which the divine scripture calls “paradise.” This will be a place of instruction, and so to speak, a lecture room or school of souls, in which they may be taught . . . and may also receive some indications of what is to follow in the future, . . . which are revealed more clearly and brightly to the saints in their proper times and places. If anyone is “pure in heart,” and of unpolluted mind, . . . he will make swifter progress and quickly ascend . . . until he reaches the kingdom of the heavens. . . . And thus he will proceed in order through each stage, following “him who has entered into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God” and who has said, “I will that, where I am, they also may be with me.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-028" id="footnote-028-backlink">4</a></sup></blockquote>
<p class="indent-1-0"><a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>Gregory of Nyssa taught the same universalist doctrine: “[God’s] end is one, and one only; it is this: when the complete whole of our race shall have been perfected from the first man to the last . . . to offer to every one of us participation in the blessings which are in Him.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-027" id="footnote-027-backlink">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Indeed, <a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>Morwenna Ludlow has recently written that “in the early Christian Church there were two important streams of eschatological thought: a universalist stream, which asserted that all people would be saved, and a dualistic stream, which stressed the two parallel fates of eternal heaven and eternal hell.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-026" id="footnote-026-backlink">6</a></sup> The first tradition was represented by, besides Origen and Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory’s sister Macrina, Maximus the Confessor, and others.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">By the advent of the Church of Christ in the nineteenth century, a plan of salvation that encompassed the entirety of humanity was barely a dim memory of the Christian past—except for a few small circles of a burgeoning movement called Universalism. Meanwhile, as <a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a>Joseph Smith labored at his re-translation of the New Testament, he paused to ponder John’s words about two resurrections only, one to life and one to death. “It appeared self-evident from what truths were left,” he recorded, “that if God rewarded every one according to the deeds done in the body, the term ‘Heaven,’ as intended for the Saints’ eternal home, must include more kingdoms than one. Accordingly, . . . while translating St. John’s Gospel, <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>myself and Elder Rigdon saw the following <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>vision.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-025" id="footnote-025-backlink">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The resulting section 76 turned Christian models upside down by proposing a three-tiered heaven that accommodated virtually every inhabitant of the planet, past and present. Two reactions registered among Latter-day Saints. Some responded Jonah-like, resentful that they would not enjoy the prestige of a salvation reserved for a few elect. As Brigham Young’s shocked brother characterized the vision, “Why the Lord was going to save everybody.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-024" id="footnote-024-backlink">8</a></sup> Some rebelled to the point that Parley Pratt traveled to New York to disfellowship protesting members.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-023" id="footnote-023-backlink">9</a></sup> Others, however, rejoiced in a heaven far more commodious than contemporary versions.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">For those receptive to the vision, then as now, two impressions prevailed. For some, the three-tiered heaven functioned effectively like the old system, with only the uppermost kingdom constituting genuine salvation. Rather like the Catholic eschatology, the restored gospel now had a hell (outer darkness), a middle realm of the almost-saved (the telestial and terrestrial kingdoms), and exaltation with God (the celestial kingdom). For the other group, the analogy with Catholicism was even starker: for in this view, those inhabiting the purgatory-like intermediate realms would eventually pass through a refiner’s fire and enter into their full glory as well. In other words, Latter-day Saints have come to conceive of salvation in two distinct ways: following a final <a id="_idIndexMarker009"></a>judgment, souls are assigned to one of three kingdoms, where they will dwell eternally with no further change in their inheritance. Or following a postmortal judgment, they will inherit a kingdom of glory; those in the telestial and terrestrial will experience further refining and instruction and purification until they have progressed into the condition and realm of exalted beings.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">For most of the Church’s history, the dominant view has seemed to be the more liberal view, one in which a long-suffering eternal parent never closes the door on the possibility of individual change of heart, and progress will be continuous. <a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>Joseph Smith himself appears to have been surprised to learn that section 76 did not teach a binding judgment in the way he first understood it to. The terrestrial world, he read, comprised those “who died without law . . . who received not the testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it” (<a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>D&amp;C 76:72, 74). His brother <a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a>Alvin, who died in Joseph’s youth, would have been in that category—or so Joseph undoubtedly assumed. Hence his happy shock when, in 1836, through spiritual eyes he saw his brother in the celestial kingdom: “And [I] <span class="emphasis">marveled</span> how it was that he had obtained an inheritance in that kingdom, seeing that he had departed this life before the Lord had set his hand to gather Israel the second time, and had not been baptized for the remission of sins” (<a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a>D&amp;C 137:6, emphasis added). One reasonable inference from Joseph’s experience, which his subsequent remarks support, is that Alvin did indeed inherit a terrestrial kingdom as described in section 76, but his progress did not end there.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">This reading is also consistent with the words of Joseph’s contemporary Charlotte Haven, who understood him to say that a spirit in the lowest kingdom “constantly progresses in spiritual knowledge until safely landed in the Celestial.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-022" id="footnote-022-backlink">10</a></sup> The <a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a>temple ritual he instituted itself recapitulates this form. In its most basic outline, temple ritual charts the progress of the individual from premortal life through mortality and into the beyond, passing through the lower two kingdoms and culminating with entry into a representation of the celestial kingdom itself. Excepting only those few who will refuse Christ’s mercy till the end, <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>Joseph later taught, man “cannot be damned through all eternity, their [<em>sic</em>] is a possibility for his escape in a little time.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-021" id="footnote-021-backlink">11</a></sup> Joseph’s brother <a id="_idIndexMarker016"></a>Hyrum also believed that no salvific state in the hereafter was static: “Hiram said Aug 1st. Those of the Terrestrial Glory either advance to the Celestial or recede to the Telestial or else the moon would not be a type, [because] it ‘waxes &amp; wanes.’”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-020" id="footnote-020-backlink">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0"><a id="_idIndexMarker017"></a>Brigham Young was exactly in line with Joseph’s thinking. He was teaching in 1855 that those who fail to secure exaltation by the conclusion of their earthly probation “would eventually have the privilege of proveing [<em>sic</em>] themselves worthy &amp; advancing to a Celestial kingdom but it would be a slow progress.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-019" id="footnote-019-backlink">13</a></sup> The prophet <a id="_idIndexMarker018"></a>Lorenzo Snow bore fervent testimony to this principle: “You that are mourning about your children straying away will . . . get all your sons and daughters in the path of exaltation and glory. This is just as sure as that the sun rose this morning over yonder mountains.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-018" id="footnote-018-backlink">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">The Church of Jesus Christ’s eminent theologian and Seventy <a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a>B. H. Roberts also explicitly interpreted Smith’s universalism to imply a steadfast progression through the kingdoms of glory. Though scripture was vague, he argued, the ministry alluded to in each kingdom seemed meaningless “unless it be for the purpose of advancing our Father’s children along the lines of eternal progression.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-017" id="footnote-017-backlink">15</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">However, whether “after education and advancement within those spheres” all could “at last emerge from them and make their way to the higher degrees of glory”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-016" id="footnote-016-backlink">16</a></sup> was not revealed. <a id="_idIndexMarker020"></a>James Talmage, virtually the only Apostle to produce a theological treatise (two, actually) under official imprimatur, wrote in his first edition of <em>The Articles of Faith</em> that the answer was implicit in the principle of eternal progression itself: “Advancement from grade to grade within any kingdom, and from kingdom to kingdom, will be provided for. . . . Eternity is progressive.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-015" id="footnote-015-backlink">17</a></sup> He later elaborated that no man will be detained in the lower regions “longer than is necessary to bring him to a fitness for something better. When he reaches that stage the prison doors will open and there will be rejoicing among the hosts who welcome him into a better state.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-014" id="footnote-014-backlink">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Slightly later, Elder <a id="_idIndexMarker021"></a>Joseph F. Smith taught:</p>
<blockquote>There is a time after this mortal life, and there is a way provided by which we may fulfil the measure of our creation and destiny, and accomplish the whole great work that we have been sent to do, although it may reach far into the future before we fully accomplish it. Jesus had not finished his work when his body was slain, neither did he finish it after his resurrection from the dead, although he had accomplished the purpose for which he then came to the earth, he had not fulfilled all his work. And when will he? Not until he has redeemed and saved every son and daughter of our father Adam that has or ever will be born upon this earth to the end of time, except the sons of perdition.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-013" id="footnote-013-backlink">19</a></sup></blockquote>
<p class="indent-1-0">In more recent years, other leaders have implied, and some explicitly stated, a comparable view. President <a id="_idIndexMarker022"></a>J. Reuben Clark maintained a sympathetic continuity with the line from Joseph through Talmage: “It is my belief that God will save all of His children that he can; and while, if we live unrighteously here, we shall not go to the other side in the same status, so to speak, as those who live righteously; nevertheless, the unrighteous will have their chance, and in the eons of the eternities that are to follow, they, too, may climb to the destinies to which they who are righteous and serve God, have climbed.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-012" id="footnote-012-backlink">20</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Some have found assurance in Joseph Smith’s comments about the power of <a id="_idIndexMarker023"></a>sealing to bind children unconditionally to their parents, though he addressed them to those who received the fulness of the priesthood. The significance of those temple sealings was interpreted by Elder <a id="_idIndexMarker024"></a>Orson F. Whitney and reaffirmed with increasing frequency in recent years: “Joseph Smith declared . . . that the eternal sealings of faithful parents and the divine promises made to them for valiant service in the Cause of Truth, would save not only themselves, but likewise their posterity. Though some of the sheep may wander, the eye of the Shepherd is upon them, and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of Divine Providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold. Either in this life or the life to come, they will return.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-011" id="footnote-011-backlink">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Recently, leaders have reminded us that even sealing power cannot contravene individual agency; President <a id="_idIndexMarker025"></a>James E. Faust believed the two principles could be reconciled: “I recognize that now is the time ‘to prepare to meet God,’” he said, affirming the words of Alma, but then asked, “If the repentance of the wayward <a id="_idIndexMarker026"></a>children does not happen in this life, is it still possible for the cords of the sealing to be strong enough for them yet to work out their repentance? . . . Mercy will not rob justice, and the sealing power of faithful parents will only claim wayward children upon the condition of their repentance and Christ’s Atonement.” And he concluded, “There are very few whose rebellion and evil deeds are so great that they have ‘sinned away the power to repent.’ . . . Perhaps in this life we are not given to fully understand how enduring the sealing cords of righteous parents are to their children. It may very well be that there are more helpful sources at work than we know. I believe there is a strong familial pull as the influence of beloved ancestors continues with us from the other side of the veil.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-010" id="footnote-010-backlink">22</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">On the other side of the question, we find a series of pronouncements that reject any possibility of progression through the kingdoms. One such early voice is Elder <a id="_idIndexMarker027"></a>Melvin J. Ballard, who posed the question of progression through the kingdoms in 1922. In reply, he quoted <a id="_idIndexMarker028"></a>Doctrine and Covenants 76:112 in regard to telestial kingdom inhabitants: “Where God and Christ dwell they cannot come, worlds without end.” He then commented that “no provision has been made for promotion from one glory to another.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-009" id="footnote-009-backlink">23</a></sup> President <a id="_idIndexMarker029"></a>George Albert Smith agreed. Quoting the same scripture, he doubted that lower kingdom inhabitants “will continue to progress until we will find ourselves in the celestial kingdom.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-008" id="footnote-008-backlink">24</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">In 1980, Elder <a id="_idIndexMarker030"></a>Bruce R. McConkie fiercely denounced the idea as one of “seven deadly heresies.” In addition to citing Doctrine and Covenants 76:112, he added a rationale to resist the teachings: “This belief lulls men into a state of carnal security. It causes them to say, ‘God is so merciful; surely he will save us all eventually; if we do not gain the celestial kingdom now, eventually we will; so why worry?’ It lets people live a life of sin here and now with the hope that they will be saved eventually.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-007" id="footnote-007-backlink">25</a></sup> As with most of his pronouncements upon Restoration doctrine, McConkie was but following the lead of his father-in-law, <a id="_idIndexMarker031"></a>Joseph Fielding Smith, who derived the same conclusion from the same scripture: “The terrestrial and the telestial are limited in their powers of advancement, worlds without end.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-006" id="footnote-006-backlink">26</a></sup> <a id="_idIndexMarker032"></a>Spencer W. Kimball, not surprisingly given the moral rigor and austerity of his writings, was of the same opinion: “After a person has been assigned to his place in the kingdom, either in the telestial, the terrestrial, or the celestial, or to his exaltation, he will never advance from his assigned glory to another glory. That is eternal!”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-005" id="footnote-005-backlink">27</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Those leaders who oppose the doctrine of eternal progression for all most commonly rely upon two scriptural texts in particular: “Where God and Christ are they cannot come, worlds without end,” in reference to the lower kingdom’s inheritors (<a id="_idIndexMarker033"></a>D&amp;C 76:112), and “This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors. . . . If ye have procrastinated the day of your <a id="_idIndexMarker034"></a>repentance even until death, . . . the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked” (<a id="_idIndexMarker035"></a>Alma 34:32, 35).<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-004" id="footnote-004-backlink">28</a></sup> Those invoking such passages appear confident that they resolve the matter beyond dispute; that so many others from Joseph Smith into the twenty-first century believe otherwise suggests those scriptures are not as unambiguous as supposed—at least in the minds of those who affirm progression through the kingdoms.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">In his reworking of Genesis, Joseph Smith learned that <a id="_idIndexMarker038"></a>Eternal is one of God’s names or titles: “Behold, I am <a id="_idIndexMarker039"></a>God; Man of Holiness is my name; Man of Counsel is my name; and Endless and Eternal is my name” (<a id="_idIndexMarker040"></a>Moses 7:35). The Lord reiterated this point to Joseph in section 19: “eternal” punishment is not endless punishment. “It is not written that there shall be no end to this torment, but it is written <span class="emphasis">endless torment.</span> Again, it is written <span class="emphasis">eternal damnation</span> . . . that it might work upon the hearts of the children of men” (<a id="_idIndexMarker041"></a>D&amp;C 19:6–7, italics in original). Together these two verses suggest that, daunting vocabulary notwithstanding, God’s underlying concern is on the educative transformation of the heart. There is deliberate and divine purposefulness, in other words, in the ambiguity of scriptural references to eternal damnation. With God as with mortals, patience and long-suffering are too easily construed as indulgence, and infinite grace too easily misunderstood as cheap grace. Like “eternal,” so is the expression “worlds without end” of ambiguous meaning. Greek scholars note that the fraught expression can suggest “prolonged time or eternity,” or “prolonged but not unending time,” just as Joseph learned was true of “eternal.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-003" id="footnote-003-backlink">29</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Advocates of progression seem to have grappled with the Alma passages as well. “Repentance will be possible . . . even after death,” wrote Elder <a id="_idIndexMarker042"></a>James E. Talmage. To some, he continued, “it may appear that to teach the possibility of repentance beyond the grave may tend to weaken belief in the absolute necessity of repentance and reformation in this life.” There is “no reason for such objection,” he explains, when we consider that willful neglect here and now will render the process that much more lengthy and difficult in the future.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-002" id="footnote-002-backlink">30</a></sup> Elder <a id="_idIndexMarker043"></a>Charles W. Penrose also taught that Alma’s focus on this-life-only repentance failed to accommodate the diversity of life experiences and opportunities. He preached in a general conference address that “there are hundreds of thousands who have heard the Gospel in the flesh and through fear or folly have not embraced it, having been afraid to come forward and join themselves with this unpopular people, when they pass away from this stage of being into the spirit world [they] will be prepared to receive it when it is being preached among the spirits that are there.”<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-001" id="footnote-001-backlink">31</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Nor are any of these leaders saying we will all be <a id="_idIndexMarker044"></a>saved “in [our] sins” (the anti-Christ Zeezrom’s mistake; <a id="_idIndexMarker045"></a>Alma 11:34). Rather, repentance—the changing of the heart—will bring us to “a fitness for something better,” as Elder <a id="_idIndexMarker046"></a>Talmage taught. As the Book of Mormon affirms, no quick fix at the end of life will suffice: “Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis [like Korihor], that I will repent” (<a id="_idIndexMarker047"></a>Alma 34:34). This is because, as <a id="_idIndexMarker048"></a>Amulek taught, we will emerge on the other side of the veil with the very same disposition with which we left this one, and time is the necessary requirement for change (Alma 34:34). The Book of Mormon also teaches that “wickedness never was happiness” (<a id="_idIndexMarker049"></a>Alma 41:10). If we “consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments” (<a id="_idIndexMarker050"></a>Mosiah 2:41), it is immediately clear why now is the time to let our hearts be remolded and our souls sanctified. No sin is without pain. Now is clearly the time to commence the abundant life, to strive to open ourselves to the joy and peace to which Christ invites us.</p>
<p class="indent-1-0">Apparently balancing faithfulness to Joseph Smith’s original generosity and liberality with a fear of the spiritual slackness a misunderstood universalism could invite, <a id="_idIndexMarker051"></a>Church leadership has refrained from officially endorsing one version of final judgment over the other, as one First Presidency communication indicates:</p>
<blockquote>Dear Brother,</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Brethren direct me to say that the Church has never announced a definite doctrine upon this point. Some of the brethren have held that it was possible in the course of progression to advance from one glory to another, invoking the principal [<em>sic</em>] of eternal progression; others of the brethren have taken the opposite view. But as stated, the Church has never announced a definite doctrine on this point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>	Sincerely your brother,</blockquote>
<blockquote>	(Signed by Joseph L. Anderson, Secretary to the First Presidency, March 5, 1952.)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-000" id="footnote-000-backlink">32</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>Thus we have the unusual example of a First Presidency communication stating that we have no official doctrine on this disputed topic.</p>
